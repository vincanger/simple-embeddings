the following is a conversation with

george hotz a.k.a

geohot his second time on the podcast

he's the founder of comma ai an

autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle

technology company

that seeks to be to tesla autopilot what

android is

to the ios they sell the

comma two device for one thousand

dollars that when installed

in many of their supported cars can keep

the vehicle centered in the lane

even when there are no lane markings it

includes

driver sensing that ensures that the

driver's eyes are on the road

as you may know i'm a big fan of driver

sensing i do believe tesla autopilot and

others

should definitely include it in their

sensor suite also

i'm a fan of android and a big fan of

george for many reasons

including his non-linear out of the box

brilliance

and the fact that he's a superstar

programmer

of a very different style than myself

styles make

fights and styles make conversations so

i

really enjoyed this chat i'm sure we'll

talk many more times on this podcast

quick mention of each sponsor followed

by some thoughts related to the episode

first is four sigmatic the maker of

delicious

mushroom coffee second is the coding

digital

a podcast on tech and entrepreneurship

that i listen to

and enjoy and finally expressvpn

and to support this podcast as a side

note

let me say that my work at mit on

autonomous and semiautonomous vehicles

led me to study the human side of

autonomy enough

to understand that it's a beautifully

complicated and interesting problem

space

much richer than what can be studied in

the lab

in that sense the data that comma ai

tesla autopilot

and perhaps others like cadillac super

crews are collecting

gives us a chance to understand how we

can design safe

semiautonomous vehicles for real human

beings

in real world conditions i think this

requires bold innovation

and a serious exploration of the first

principles of the driving task

and now here's my conversation with

george

hotz so last time we started talking

about the simulation

this time let me ask you do you think

there's intelligent life out there in

the universe

i've always maintained my answer to the

fermi paradox i think there

has been intelligent life elsewhere in

the universe

so the intelligent civilizations existed

but they've blown themselves up so your

general intuition is that intelligent

civilizations quickly like there's that

parameter

in in the drake equation your senses

they don't last very long

yeah how are we doing on that like have

we lasted pretty

pretty good i don't know we do oh yeah

i mean not quite yet

well what telly has your caskey the iq

required to destroy the world falls by

one point every year

okay so technology democratizes

the destruction of the world when can a

meme destroy the world

it kind of is already right somewhat

i don't think i don't think we've seen

anywhere near the worst of it yet

world's going to get weird well maybe a

mu can save the world

you thought about that the meme lord

elon musk fighting on the side of good

versus the uh the meme lord of the

darkness which is uh not saying anything

bad about donald trump

but he is the the lord of the meme on

the dark side he's a darth vader of

memes

i think in every fairy tale

they always end it with and they lived

happily ever after and i'm like please

tell me more about this happily ever

after i've heard

50 percent of marriages end in divorce

uh why doesn't your marriage end up

there you can't just say happily ever

after so

it's the thing about destruction is it's

over after the destruction

um we have to do everything right in

order to avoid it

and uh one thing wrong i mean actually

that's what i really like about

cryptography

cryptography it seems like we live in a

world where the defense wins

um versus like nuclear weapons the

opposite is true

it is much easier to build a warhead

that splits into 100 little warheads

than to build something that can

you know take out 100 little warheads uh

the offense has the advantage there

um so maybe our future is in crypto but

uh so cryptography right the goliath is

the

the defense and then all the different

hackers

are the uh are the davids and that

equation is flipped for nuclear war

because there's so many like one nuclear

weapon destroys everything

essentially yeah and it is much easier

to uh

attack with a nuclear weapon than it is

to like the technology required to

intercept and destroy

a rocket is much more complicated than

the technology required to just you know

orbital trajectory send a rocket to

somebody

so okay your intuition that the there

were intelligent

civilizations out there but it's very

possible that they're

no longer there that's kind of a sad

picture they

enter some steady state they all

wirehead themselves

what's wirehead um stimulate stimulate

their pleasure centers

uh and just you know live forever in

this kind of stasis

they become well i mean i think the

reason i believe this is because where

are they

if there's some reason they stopped

expanding

because otherwise they would have taken

over the universe the universe isn't

that big or at least you know

let's just talk about the galaxy right

70 000 light years across

uh i took that number from star trek

voyager i don't know how true it is but

um

uh yeah that's not big right 70

000 light years is nothing for some

possible technology that you can imagine

that could leverage like wormholes or

something like that

you don't even need wormholes just a von

neumann probe is enough a von

neumann probe and a million years of

sublight travel and you'd have taken

over the whole universe

that clearly uh didn't happen so

something stopped it

so you mean if you right for for like a

few million years

if you sent out probes that travel close

what's sublight

meaning close to the speed of light

let's it just spreads

interesting actually that's an

interesting calculation

huh so what makes you think that would

be able to uh communicate with them

like uh yeah what what's

why do you think we would able to be

able to comprehend

intelligent lives that are out there

like

even if they were among us kind of thing

like

or even just flying around well

i mean that's possible it's possible

that there is some sort of prime

directive

uh that'd be a really cool universe to

live in um and there's some reason

they're not making themselves visible to

us

but it makes sense that they would use

the same

well at least the same entropy well

you're implying the same laws of physics

i don't know what you mean by entropy

in this case oh yeah i mean if entropy

is the scarce resource in the universe

so what do you think about like stephen

wolfram and everything is a computation

and then what if they are traveling

through this world of computation so

if you think of the universe as just

information processing

then uh what you're referring to with

with entropy

and then these these pockets of

interesting complex computations

swimming around

how do we know they're not already here

how do we know that this like all the

different

amazing things that are full of mystery

on earth

are just like little footprints of

intelligence from

light years away maybe i mean

i tend to think that as civilizations

expand they use more and more energy

uh and you can never overcome the

problem of waste heat so where is their

waste heat

so we'd be able to with our crude

methods be able to see like there's a

whole lot of

energy here but it could be something

we're not i mean we don't understand

dark energy right dark matter

it could be just stuff we don't

understand at all or they could have a

fundamentally different physics

you know like that that we just don't

even compromise well i think

okay i mean it depends how far out you

want to go i don't think physics is very

different on the other side of the

galaxy

i would suspect that they have i mean if

they're in our

universe they have the same physics well

yeah that's the assumption we have

but there could be like super trippy

things like

like our cognition

only gets to a slice oh and all the

possible instruments that we can design

only get to a particular slice of the

universe and there's something much

like weirder maybe we can try a thought

experiment

um would people from the past

be able to detect the remnants of our

uh we would be able to detect our modern

civilization i think the answer is

obviously yes

you mean past from 100 years ago well

let's even go back further let's go to a

million years ago

right the humans who were lying around

in the desert probably didn't even have

maybe they just barely had fire uh

they would understand if a 747 flew

overhead

in in in this vicinity but not um

if the if a 747 flew on mars

because they wouldn't be able to see far

because we're not actually communicating

that well

with the rest of the universe we're

doing okay we're just sending out random

like

50s tracks of music true

and yeah i mean they'd have to you know

the we've only been broadcasting radio

waves for

um 150 years and well there's your light

cone

so yeah okay what do you make about all

the

i recently came across this uh having

talked to

david fravor i don't know if you caught

what the

the videos that pentagon released and

uh the new york times reporting of the

ufo sightings

so i kind of looked into it quote

unquote and

there's actually been like

hundreds of thousands of ufo sightings

right

and a lot of it you can explain away in

different kinds of ways

so one is it could be interesting

physical phenomena

two it could be people wanting to

believe

and therefore they conjure up a lot of

different things that just you know when

you see different kinds of lights some

basic physics phenomena

and then you just conjure up ideas of

possible

out there mysterious worlds but you know

it's also possible like you have a case

of

david fravor who is a navy pilot

who's you know as legit as a guest in

terms of

humans who are able to perceive

things in the environment and make

conclusions whether those things are a

threat or not

and he and several other pilots saw

a thing i don't know if you followed

this but they saw a thing that they've

since then called tick tock that moved

in all kinds of weird ways

they don't know what it is it could be

technology developed by by the united

states

and they're just not aware of it and the

surface level from the navy right it

could be

different kind of lighting technology or

drone technology all that kind of stuff

it could be the russians and then

chinese all that kind of stuff

and of course their mind our mind

can also venture into the possibility

that it's from another world

have you looked into this at all what do

you think about it

i think all the news is a psyop

i think that the most closing is real

yeah i listened to the uh i think it was

bob lazar

um on joe rogan and like i believe

everything this guy is saying and then i

think that it's probably just some like

mk ultra kind of thing you know

uh what do you mean like they they uh

you know they made some weird thing and

they called it an alien spaceship you

know maybe it was just to like

stimulate young physicist minds we'll

tell them it's alien technology and

we'll see what they come up with right

do you find any conspiracy theories

compelling like have you

pulled at the string of the of the rich

complex world of conspiracy theories

that's out there

i think that uh i've heard a conspiracy

theory that conspiracy theories were

invented by the cia

in the 60s to discredit true things yeah

um so you know you can go to ridiculous

conspiracy theories like flat earth and

pizzagate

and uh you know these things are almost

to hide like

conspiracy theories that like you know

remember when the chinese like locked up

the doctors who discovered coronavirus

like i tell people this and i'm like

no no that's not a conspiracy theory

that actually happened

do you remember the time that the money

used to be backed by gold and now it's

backed by nothing this is not a

conspiracy theory this actually

happened that's one of my worries

today with the idea of fake news is that

when nothing is real

then like you dilute the possibility of

anything being true by

conjuring up all kinds of conspiracy

theories and then you don't know what to

believe and then

like the idea of truth of objectivity is

lost completely

everybody has their own truth so you

used to control information by censoring

it

then the internet happened and

governments are like oh we can't

censor things anymore

i know what we'll do you know it's the

old story

of uh the story of like tying a flag

where the leprechaun tells you the gold

is buried

and you tie one flag and you make the

leprechaun swear to not remove the flag

and you come back to the field later

with a shovel and there's flags

everywhere

that's one way to maintain privacy right

is like

in order to protect the contents of this

conversation for example we could just

generate like millions of deep fake

conversations where you and i talk

and say random things yeah so this is

just one of them and nobody knows which

one was the real one

this this could be fake right now

classic steganography technique

okay another absurd question about

intelligent life because uh

you know you're you're an incredible

programmer outside of everything else

we'll talk about just as a programmer

uh do you think intelligent beings out

there the civilizations that were out

there

had computers and programming

did they do we naturally have to develop

something where we engineer machines

and are able to encode both

knowledge into those machines and

instructions that

process that knowledge process that

information to to make decisions and

actions and so on

and with those programming languages if

you think they exist

be at all similar to anything we've

developed

so i don't see that much of a difference

between

quote-unquote natural languages and

programming languages

um yeah i think there's so many

similarities so

when asked the question what do alien

languages look like

i imagine they're not all that

dissimilar from ours

and i think translating in and out of

them

uh wouldn't be that crazy well it's

difficult to compile

like dna to python and then to see

i mean there is a little bit of a gap in

in the kind of languages we use for

for uh touring machines and the kind of

languages

nature seems to use a little bit maybe

that's just

we just haven't cr we haven't understood

the kind of language that nature uses

well

yet dna is a cad model

it's not quite a programming language it

has no sort of

serial execution it's not quite a

yeah it's a cad model um so i think in

that sense

we actually completely understand it the

problem is um you know

well simulating on these cad models i

played with it a bit this year

is super uh computationally intensive if

you want to go down to like the

molecular level

um where you need to go to see a lot of

these phenomena like protein folding

um so yeah it's not that it's it's not

it's not that we don't understand it it

just requires a whole lot of compute to

kind of

compile it for our human minds it's

inefficient both for the pro

for the data representation and for the

programming yeah it runs well on raw

nature

it runs well in raw nature and when we

try to build uh emulators or simulators

for that

uh well then manslaughter and i've tried

it

it runs in yeah you've commented

elsewhere

i don't remember where that uh

one of the problems is simulating nature

is tough

and if you want to sort of deploy a

prototype

i forgot how you you put it but it made

me laugh but animals or humans would

need to be involved

in order to in order to try to run some

prototype code on um

like if we're talking about covid and

viruses and so on yeah

if you were trying to engineer some kind

of defense mechanisms

like a vaccine uh against coven or

all that kind of stuff that doing any

kind of experimentation like you can

with like autonomous vehicles would be

very

technically cost technically and

ethically costly i'm not sure about that

i think you can do tons of

uh crazy biology and in test tubes i

think

my bigger complaint is more all the

tools are so bad

like literally you mean like like i'm

not libraries and i'm not pipetting

like you're handing me a i gotta no no

no no there has to be some

like automating stuff and like the

yeah but human biology is messy like it

seems like

look at those toronto's videos they were

a joke it's like it's like a little

gantry it's like a little xy gantry high

school science project with the pipette

i'm like

really gotta be something better you

can't build like nice microfluidics and

i can program the you know

computation to bio interface i mean this

is going to happen

but like right now if you are asking me

to pipette

50 milliliters of solution amount

this is so crude yeah okay

let's get all the crazy out of the way

uh so a bunch of people ask me

since we talked about the simulation

last time we talked about hacking the

simulation

do you have any updates any insights

about how we might be able to go about

hacking simulation if we indeed do live

in a simulation

i think a lot of people misinterpreted

the point of that south by talk

the point of the south by talk was not

literally to hack the simulation

uh i think that this

we this is this is an idea is literally

just i think theoretical physics i think

that's the whole

you know the whole goal

right you want your grand unified theory

but then okay build a brand new five

theory search for exploits

right i think we're nowhere near

actually there yet

my hope with that was just more to like

like are you people kidding me with the

things you spend time thinking about

do you understand like kind of how small

you are

you are you are bites and god's computer

really and the things that people get

worked up about and

you know so basically it was more

a message of uh we should humble

ourselves

that we we get to uh like what

what are we humans in this bite code

yeah

and not just just humble ourselves but

like like i'm not trying to like make

you feel guilty or anything like that

i'm trying to say like literally

look at what you are spending time on

right what are you referring to you're

referring to the kardashians what are we

talking about

from twitter to no the kardashians see

everyone knows that's kind of

fun i'm referring more to like the

economy

you know this idea that

we gotta up our stock price like

or or what is what is the goal function

of humanity

you don't like the game of capitalism

like you don't like the games we've

constructed for ourselves as humans

i'm a big fan of of capitalism i don't

think that's really the game we're

playing right now i think we're playing

a

a different game where the rules are

rigged

look at which games are interesting to

you that we humans have constructed and

which aren't

which are productive and which

are not actually maybe that's the real

point of the

of the talk it's like stop playing these

fake human games there's a real game

here

we can play the real game the real game

is you know nature wrote the rules

this is a real game there still is a

game to play

but if you look at sergeant drop i don't

know if you've seen the instagram

account nature is metal

the game that nature seems to be playing

is a lot

a lot more cruel than we humans want to

put up with or

at least we see it as cool it's like the

bigger

thing eats the smaller thing and uh

does it to impress another big thing

so it can mate with that thing and

that's it that

seems to be the entirety of it well

there's no art there's no music there's

no

comma ai there's no comma one no comma

two no george

hotz with his brilliant talks at south

by southwest

see i disagree though i disagree that

this is what nature is i think nature

just provided basically a uh

open world and mmorpg and um

you know here it's open world i mean if

that's the game you want to play you can

play that game but

isn't that isn't that beautiful i know

if you play diablo they used to have uh

i think cow level

where it's

so everybody will go just they figured

out this like the best way to gain

like experience points is to just

slaughter cows over and over and over

and uh so they figured out this little

sub game within the bigger game that

this is the most efficient way

to get experience points and everybody

somehow agreed that getting experience

points in

rpg context where you always want to be

getting more stuff

more skills more levels keep advancing

that seems to be good

so might as well spend sacrifice

actual enjoyment of playing a game

exploring a world

and spending like hundreds of hours of

your time in cow level i mean

the number of hours i spent in cow level

i'm not like the most impressive person

because people have probably thousands

of hours there but it's ridiculous

so that's a little absurd game that

brought me joy in some weird dopamine

drug kind of way

yeah so you you don't like those games

you don't

you don't think that's us humans failing

the the yeah nature i think so

and that was the point of the talk yeah

so how do we hack it then

well i want to live forever and wait

i want to live forever and this is like

the goal well that's a game against

nature

yeah immortality is the good objective

function to you

i mean start there and then you can do

whatever else you want cause you got a

long time

what if mortality makes the game just

totally not fun

i mean like why do you assume

immortality

is uh somehow uh it's not

a good objective function it's not

immortality that i want a true

immortality where i could not die

i would prefer what we have right now um

but i want to choose my own death of

course

i don't want nature to decide when i die

i'm going to win i'm going to be you

and then at some point if you choose

commit suicide

like how long you think you'd live

until i get bored see i don't think

people

like in like brilliant people like you

that really

ponder living a long time

are really considering how

how meaningless life becomes well i want

to know everything and then i'm ready

to die

as long as why do you want isn't it

possible that you want to know

everything because

it's finite like the reason you want to

know quote unquote everything is because

you don't have enough time to know

everything

and once you have unlimited time then

you realize like

why do anything like why learn anything

i want to know everything and i'm ready

to die so you have yeah

well it's not it's not a like it's a

terminal value it's not

it's not in service of anything else i'm

conscious of the possibility this is not

a certainty

but the possibility is of that engine of

curiosity that you're speaking to

is actually a

a symptom of uh the finiteness of life

like

without that finiteness

your curiosity would vanish like like a

like a morning fog

all right cool then you talked about

love like that then um

let me solve immortality let me change

the thing in my brain that reminds me of

the fact that i'm immortal tells me that

life is finite maybe i'll have it

tell me that life ends next week

right i'm okay with some self

manipulation like that i'm okay with

with deceiving oh change

oh rico changing the code if that's the

problem right if the problem is that i

will no longer have that

that curiosity i'd like to have backup

copies of myself

uh which yeah well which i check in with

occasionally to make sure they're okay

with the trajectory and they can kind of

override it

maybe a nice like i think of like those

wavenets those like logarithmic go back

to the copies yeah but sometimes it's

not reversible like uh

sure i've done this with video games

when once you figure out the cheat code

or like you look up

how to cheat old school like single

player

it ruins the game for you absolutely i

know that feeling but again

that just means our brain manipulation

technology is not good enough yet remove

that cheat code from your brain

what if we all so it's also possible

that if we figure out immortality

that all of us will kill ourselves

before we advance

far enough to uh to be able to revert to

change

i'm not killing myself till i know

everything so

that's what you say now because your

life is finite

you know i think yes self-modifying

systems gets

comes up with all these hairy

complexities and can i promise that i'll

do it perfectly no but i think i can put

good safety structures in place

so that talk in your thinking here is

not literally

referring to uh a simulation in that our

our universe is a kind of computer

program running in a computer

that's more of a thought experiment um

do you also think of the potential of

the sort of uh

bostrom elon musk

and others that talk about an actual

program

that simulates our universe oh i don't

doubt that we're in a simulation i just

think that it's not

quite that important i mean i'm

interested only in simulation theory as

far as like it gives me power

over nature uh if it's totally

unfalsifiable then

who cares i mean what do you think that

experiment would look like like somebody

uh

on twitter asked ask george what signs

we would look for to know whether or not

we're in the simulation

which is exactly what you're asking is

like

the step that precedes the step of

knowing how to get more power

from this knowledge is to get an

indication that there is some power to

be gained so

get an indication that there you can

discover

and exploit cracks in the simulation or

it doesn't

you know in the physics of the universe

yeah

show me i mean like a memory leak would

be cool

like some scrying technology you know

what what kind of technology

scrying what's that oh that's a weird uh

this crying is the

is the uh paranormal ability to uh

like like remote viewing like being able

to see somewhere where you're not

um so you know i don't think you can do

it by chanting in a room but um

if we could find as a memory leak

basically

yeah you're able to access parts you're

not supposed to yeah yeah yeah and

thereby discover shortcut

yeah maybe memory leak means the other

thing as well but i mean like yeah like

an ability to read arbitrary memory

yeah right and that one's not that

horrifying right the the right ones

start to be horrifying

read right so the the reading is not the

problem yeah

it's like heartbleed for the universe oh

boy the writing is a big big problem

it's a big problem it's the moment you

can write anything even if it's just

random noise that's terrifying

i mean even without even without that

like even some of the you know the

nanotech stuff that's coming i think is

i don't know if you're paying attention

but actually eric weinstein came out

with the theory of everything

i mean that came out he's been working

on a theory of everything in the physics

world

called geometric community and then for

me from computer science person

like you stephen wolfram's theory of

everything of like hypographs is super

interesting and beautiful

but not from a physics perspective but

from a computational perspective i don't

know have you paid attention

to any of that so again like what would

make me pay attention and like why like

i hate string theory is okay make a

testable prediction

right i'm only interested in i'm not

interested in theories for their

intrinsic beauty i'm interested in

theories that give me power over the

universe

so if these theories do i'm very

interested um can i just say how

beautiful that

is because a lot of physicists say i'm

interested in experimental validation

and they skip out the part

where they say to give me more power in

the universe

i just love the um yo i want i want i

want the clarity of that

i want 100 gigahertz processors i want

transistors that are smaller than atoms

i want like

power

that's uh that's true and that's where

people

from aliens to this kind of technology

where people are worried that

governments like who owns that power

is it george hearts is it thousands of

distributed hackers across the world

is it governments you know is it mark

zuckerberg

there's a lot of people that uh

i don't know if anyone trusts any one

individual with power so they're always

worried

it's the beauty of blockchains that's

the beauty of blockchains

which we'll talk about on twitter

somebody pointed me to a story uh

a bunch of people pointed me to a story

a few months ago

where you went into a restaurant in new

york and you can correct me fame this is

wrong

and ran into a bunch of folks from a

company in a

crypto company who are trying to scale

up ethereum

and they had a technical deadline

related to a solidity to ovm compiler

so these are all ethereum technologies

so

you stepped in they recognized you uh

pulled you aside explained their problem

and you stepped in and helped them solve

the problem

uh thereby creating legend status

story so uh can you uh

tell me the story the little more detail

it seems kind of incredible

this did this happen yeah yeah it's a

true story it's a true story i mean they

wrote a very flattering

account of it um they

so optimism is the spin the company's

called optimism

spin-off of plasma they're trying to

build l2 solutions on ethereum

so right now uh

every ethereum node has to run every

transaction

on the ethereum network um and this kind

of doesn't scale right because if you

have n computers

well you know if that becomes two n

computers you actually still get the

same amount of compute

right this is this is like like o of one

scaling

um because they all have to run it okay

fine you get more

blockchain security but like the

blockchain's already so secure

can we trade some of that off for speed

uh so that's kind of what these l2

solutions are

they built this thing which kind of um

kind of sandbox

uh for ethereum contracts so they can

run it in this l2 world and it can't do

certain things in l world

in l1 i can ask you for some definitions

what's l2

oh l2 is layer 2. so l1 is like the base

ethereum chain

and then layer two is like a

computational layer that runs

um elsewhere but still is kind of

secured by layer one

and i'm sure a lot of people know but

ethereum is a cryptocurrency probably

one of the most popular cryptocurrencies

second to bitcoin

and a lot of interesting technological

innovations there

maybe you can also slip in

whenever you talk about this any things

that are exciting to you in the

ethereum space and why ethereum well i

mean

bitcoin uh is not turn complete

well ethereum is not technically a

terrain complete with a gas limit but

close enough

well the gas limit what's the gas limit

resources

yeah i mean no computers actually turn

complete right right

you're fine at ram you know what if i

can actually solve this gas limit you

just have so many brilliant

words i'm not even gonna ask but that's

what that's no that's not my word that's

ethereum's word

gasoline ethereum you have to spend gas

per instruction

so like different op codes use different

amounts of gas and you

buy gas with ether to prevent people

from basically ddosing the network

so uh bitcoin is proof of work and then

what's ethereum it's also proof of work

uh they're working on some

proof-of-stake ethereum 2.0 stuff but

right now it's

it's proof of work usually a different

hash function from bitcoin that's more

asic resistance because you need ram

so we're all talking about ethereum 1.0

yeah so what uh

what were they trying to do to scale

this whole process so they were like

well

if we could run contracts elsewhere um

and then only save the results of that

computation

uh you know well we don't actually have

to do the computer on the chain we can

do the compute off chain and just post

what the results are

now the problem with that is well

somebody could lie about what the

results are

so you need a resolution mechanism and

the resolution mechanism can be really

expensive

uh because you know you just have to

make sure that like

the person who is saying look i swear

that this is the real computation

i'm staking ten thousand dollars on that

fact and

if you prove it wrong yeah it might cost

you three thousand dollars in gas fees

to prove wrong

but you'll get the ten thousand dollar

bounty so you can secure

using those kind of systems um

so it's effectively a sandbox which runs

contracts

uh and like just like any kind of normal

sandbox you have to like replace

syscalls with um you know calls into the

hypervisor

uh sandbox this calls hypervisor what do

these things mean

uh as long as it's interesting to talk

about yeah i mean you can take like the

chrome

is maybe the one to think about right so

the chrome process that's doing a

rendering

uh can't for example read a file from

the file system yeah

it has if it tries to make an open

syscall in linux the open system

you can't make it open says call no no

no uh you have to request

from the kind of uh hypervisor process

or

like i don't know what's called in

chrome but um

the canoe hey could you open this file

for me and then it does all these checks

and then it passes the file handle back

in if it's approved

um so that's yeah uh so what's the in

the context of ethereum

what are the boundaries of the sandbox

that we're talking about um well like

one of the calls that you

actually reading and uh writing any

state to the ethereum contract

to the ethereum blockchain um

writing state is one of those calls that

you're going to have to sandbox

in layer two because if you let layer

two just

arbitrarily right to the ethereum

blockchain um

so layer two is except is really sitting

on top of

layer one so you're gonna have a lot of

different kinds of ideas that you can

play with

yeah and they're all they're not

fundamentally changing

the source code level of ethereum

well you have to replace a bunch of

calls

with calls into the hypervisor so

instead of doing the syscall directly

you you replace it with a call to the

hypervisor

so originally they were doing this by

first running the so solidity is the

language that most ethereum contracts

are written in

it compiles to a byte code and then they

wrote this thing they called the

transpiler and the transpiler took the

byte code

and it transpiled it into ovm safe

bytecode

basically bytecode that didn't make any

of those restricted syscalls and added

the calls to the hypervisor

this transpiler was a 3000 line mess

and it's hard to do it's hard to do if

you're trying to do it like that because

you have to kind of like deconstruct the

byte code

change things about it and then

reconstruct it

and i mean as soon as i hear this i'm

like why don't you just change the

compiler

right why not the first place you build

the bytecode just do it in the compiler

uh so yeah you know i asked them how

much they wanted it

uh of course measured in dollars and i'm

like well okay

um and yeah and you wrote the compiler

yeah i modified i wrote a 300 line diff

to the compiler

uh it's open source you can look at it

yeah it's yeah i looked at the code last

night

[Laughter]

yeah exactly cute good is a good word

for it

uh and it's um c plus plus

see if it's lost yeah so when

asked how you were able to do it you

said

you just gotta think and then do it

right

so can you break that apart a little bit

what's what's your process of uh

one thinking and two doing it right

you know they they the people i was

working for are amused that i said that

it doesn't really mean anything

okay i mean is there some

deep profound insights to draw from like

how you problem solve from that because

this is always what i say i'm like do

you want to be a good programmer do it

for 20 years

yeah there's no shortcuts yeah

what are your thoughts on crypto in

general so would

what what parts technically or

philosophically do you find especially

beautiful maybe

oh i'm extremely bullish on crypto long

term not any specific crypto project

but this idea of

well two ideas one um

the nakamoto consensus algorithm is

i think one of the greatest innovations

of the 21st century

this idea that people can reach

consensus you can reach a group

consensus

using a relatively straightforward

algorithm

um is wild and

like you know satoshi nakamoto people

always ask me who i look up to it's like

whoever that is who do you think it is i

mean

elon musk is it you it is definitely not

me and i do not think it's elon musk

but yeah this idea of uh

groups reaching consensus in a

decentralized yet formulaic way

is one extremely powerful idea from

crypto

maybe the second idea is this idea of

smart contracts

when you write a contract between two

parties

any contract um this contract

if there are disputes it's interpreted

by lawyers

lawyers are just really shitty overpaid

interpreters

imagine you had let's talk about them in

terms of a in terms of like let's

compare a lawyer to python

right so lawyer well okay that's really

oh i never thought of it that way it's

hilarious

so python i'm paying i'm paying um

you know even 10 cents an hour i'll use

the nice azure machine i can run python

for 10 cents an hour

lawyers cost a thousand dollars an hour

so python is is is

10 000 x uh better on that axis um

lawyers don't always return the same

answer

um python almost always does

uh cost

yeah i mean just just cost reliability

everything about python is so much

better than lawyers um so if you can

make smart contracts

this whole concept of code is law

i i love and i would love to live in a

world where everybody accepted that fact

so so maybe uh you can talk about what

smart contracts

are so let's say um

let's say you know we have a uh

even something as simple as a safety

deposit box

right safety deposit box that holds a

million dollars

i have a contract with the bank that

says two out of these three parties

uh must uh be present to open the safety

deposit box and get the money out

so that's a contract for the bank and

it's only as good as the bank and the

lawyers right

let's say you know somebody dies and now

oh we're going to go through a big legal

dispute about whether oh well was it in

the will was it not in the well

what like it's just so messy and the

cost

to determine truth is so expensive

versus a smart contract which just uses

cryptography to check if two out of

three keys are present

well i can look at that and i can have

certainty

in the answer that it's going to return

that's what all businesses want

certainty you know they say businesses

don't care viacom youtube

youtube's like look we don't care which

way this lawsuit goes

just please tell us so we can have

certainty yeah i wonder how many

agreements in this world because we're

talking about financial transactions

only in this case correct the smart the

smart contracts oh you can go to you can

go to anything

you can go you could put a prenup in the

theorem blockchain

a married smart contract sorry divorce

lawyers sorry you're going gonna be

replaced by

python uh

okay so that's uh

so that's that's another beautiful idea

do you think

there's something that's appealing to

you about any one specific

implementation

so if you look 10 20 50 years down the

line

do you see any like bitcoin ethereum

any of the other hundreds of

cryptocurrencies winning out is there

like what's your intuition about the

space are you just sitting back and

watching the chaos and look who cares

what emerges

oh i don't i don't speculate i don't

really care i don't really care which

one of these projects wins

i'm kind of in the bitcoin as a meme

coin camp i mean why does bitcoin have

value

it's technically kind of you know

what yeah not great like the block size

debate or

when i found out what the block size

debate was i'm like are you guys

kidding what's the block size debate

you know what it's really it's too

stupid to even talk about people

people people can look it up but i'm

like wow you know ethereum seems the

governance of ethereum seems much better

um i've come around i've been on proof

of stake ideas

uh you know very smart people thinking

about some things yeah

you know governance is interesting it

does feel like uh

vitalik it could just feel like an

open in even in these distributed

systems leaders and

are helpful because they kind of

help you drive the mission and the

vision

and they put a face to a project it's a

weird thing about us humans

geniuses are helpful like mattel right

yeah

brilliant

leaders are not necessarily yeah

so you think the reason he's uh he's the

face

of a theorem is because he's a genius

that's interesting

i mean that was um

it's interesting to think about that we

need to create systems

in which uh the quote unquote leaders

that emerge

are the geniuses in the system i mean

that's

arguably why the current state of

democracy is broken is the people who

are

emerging as the leaders are not the most

competent are not the superstars of the

system

and it seems like at least for now in

the crypto world oftentimes

the leaders are the superstars imagine

at the debate they asked

what's the sixth amendment what are the

four fundamental forces in the universe

right what's the integral of two to the

x

yeah i i'd love to see those questions

asked and that's what i want as our

leader

it's it's a little bit of a bayes rule

yeah i mean even oh wow you're hurting

my brain

it's that my standard was even lower but

i would have loved to see just this

basic

brilliance like i've talked to

historians there's just these

they're not even like they don't have a

phd or even education history they just

like a dan carlin type character who

just like

holy how did all this information

get into your head

they're able to just connect uh genghis

khan to

the entirety of the history of the 20th

century they

they know everything about every single

battle that happened

and they know the the the like

the game of thrones of the of the

different power plays and all that

happened there

and they know like the individuals they

know all the documents involved

and it's and that they integrate that

into their regular life it's not like

they're ultra history nerds they're just

they know this information that's what

competence looks like yeah

because i've seen that with programmers

too right that's what great programmers

do

but yeah it would be uh it's really

unfortunate that those kinds of people

aren't emerging as as our leaders but

for

now at least in the crypto world that

seems to be the case

i don't know if that always uh you could

imagine that in a hundred years that's

not the case right the crypto world has

one very powerful idea going for it and

that's the idea of forks

right i mean

you know imagine uh

we'll use a less controversial example

um this was actually in my joke

uh app in 2012 i was like barack obama

mitt romney let's let him both be

president right like imagine we could

fork america

and just let them both be president and

then the americas could compete

and you know people could invest in one

pull their liquidity out of one put it

in the other

you have this in the crypto world

ethereum forks into ethereum and

ethereum classic

and you can pull your liquidity out of

one and put it in another

and people vote with their dollars um

which forks companies should be able to

fork

i'd love to fork nvidia you know

yeah like different business strategies

and yeah and then try them out and see

see what works like even take uh

uh yeah take comedy i that closes its

source

and then take one that's open source and

see what works

take one that's purchased by gm and one

that remains

android renegade and all these different

versions and see the beauty of comma ai

is someone could actually do that

yeah please take come ai and fork it

that's right

that's the beauty of open source so

you're i mean

we'll talk about autonomous vehicle

space but it does seem that

you're really knowledgeable about

a lot of different topics so the natural

question a bunch of people ask this

which is

uh how do you keep learning new things

do you have

like practical advice if you were to

introspect

like taking notes allocate time

or do you just mess around and just

allow your curiosity to drive i'll write

these people a self-help book and i'll

charge 67

for it and i will i will write i will

write chapter one i will write on the

cover of the self-help

book all of this advice is completely

meaningless you're gonna be a sucker and

buy this book anyway

yeah and the one lesson that i hope they

take away from the book

is that i can't give you a meaningful

answer to that

that's interesting let me translate that

is you haven't really thought about what

it is you do

systematically because you could reduce

it and there's some people i mean i've

met

brilliant people that this is really

clear with athletes

some are just you know the best in the

world that's something

and they they have zero interest in

writing like a self-help book

but or how to master this game and then

there's

some athletes who become great coaches

and they love the analysis

perhaps the over analysis and you right

now at least at your age

which isn't interesting you're in the

middle of the battle you're like the

warriors that have zero interest in

writing books

uh so you're in the middle of the battle

so you have yeah

this is this is a fair point i do think

i have a certain aversion

to um this kind of deliberate

intentional way of living life

here eventually the hilarity of this

especially

since this is recorded

it will reveal beautifully the absurdity

when you finally do publish this book

and i guarantee you you will the story

of comma ai

would be maybe it'll be a biography

written about you

they'll be they'll be better i guess and

you might be able to learn some cute

lessons if you're starting a company

like comma ai from that book

but if you're asking generic questions

like how do i be good at things

dude i don't know well learn i mean the

interesting do them a lot

i do them a lot but the interesting

thing here is

learning things outside

of your current trajectory which is what

it feels like from an outsider's

perspective i mean that

uh you know that i don't know if there's

an advice on that

but it is an interesting curiosity when

you become really busy

you're running a company

part time yeah

but like there's a natural inclination

and

trend like just the the the momentum of

life

carries you into a particular direction

of wanting to focus and this kind of

dispersion that curiosity can lead to

gets harder and harder with time because

you're

you get really good at certain things

and it sucks

trying things that you're not good at

like trying to figure them out

you do this with your live streams

you're on the

fly figuring stuff out you don't mind

looking dumb

you just figured out figure it out

pretty quickly sometimes i try things

and i don't figure them out

my chest rating is like a 1400 despite

putting like

a couple hundred hours in it's pathetic

i mean to be fair i know that i could do

it better if i did it better like don't

play you know don't play five-minute

games play 15-minute games at least like

i know these things but it just doesn't

it doesn't stick nicely in my knowledge

tree

all right let's talk about comma ai

what's the mission of the company

let's like look at the biggest picture

oh i have an exact statement

solve self-driving cars while delivering

shippable intermediaries

so long-term vision is have

fully autonomous vehicles and make sure

you're making money along the way

i think it doesn't really speak to money

but i can talk i can talk about what

solve self-driving cars means

solve self-driving cars of course means

um

you're not building a new car you're

building a person replacement

uh that person can sit in the driver's

seat and drive you anywhere a person can

drive

with a human or better level of safety

speed quality comfort

and what's the second part of that

delivering shippable intermediaries

um is well it's a way to fund the

company that's true but it's also a way

to keep us honest

uh if you don't have that it is very

easy

with this technology to think you're

making progress when you're not

i've heard it best described on hacker

news as

you can set any arbitrary milestone

meet that milestone and still be

infinitely far away from solving

self-driving cars

so it's hard to have like real deadlines

when you're like

cruz or waymo

when uh you don't have uh revenue

is that i mean is revenue essentially

the thing we're talking about here

revenue is

is capitalism is based around consent

capitalism the way that you get revenue

is kind of

real capitalism commas in the real

capital is in camp there's definitely

scams out there but

real capitalism is based around consent

it's based around this idea that like if

we're getting revenue

it's because we're providing at least

that much value another person when

someone buys a thousand dollar comment

two from us

we're providing them at least a thousand

dollars of value where they wouldn't buy

it brilliant

so can you give a whirlwind overview of

the products that come i

provides like uh throughout its history

and today

i mean yeah the past ones aren't really

that interesting it's kind of just been

refinement of the same idea uh

the real only product we sell today is

the comma two which is a piece of

hardware

with cameras um so the comet to

i mean you can think about it kind of

like a person uh you know when future

hardware will probably be even more and

more person-like

um so it has uh you know eyes

ears a mouth a brain

uh and a way to interface with the car

does it have consciousness

just kidding that was a trick question

because i don't have consciousness

either

me and the common two are the same

they're the same i have a little more

compute than it

it only has like the same computer

interesting b

uh you know you're more efficient energy

wise

for the compute you're doing far more

efficient energy-wise

huh 20 paid flaps 20 watts crazy you

lack consciousness

sure do you fear death you do you want

immortality

does comey i fear death i don't think so

of course it does it very much fears

while it fears negative loss

oh yeah okay

so come a comma two when did that come

out that that was a year ago

no two uh early this year

wow time it feels like yeah

2020 feels like uh it's taken 10 years

to get to the end it's a long year

it's a long year so um

what uh what's the sexiest thing about

comma

too feature-wise so i mean maybe you can

also link on like

what is it like what's its purpose

because there's a hardware there's a

software component

you've mentioned the sensors but also

like what is of its features and

capabilities

i think our slogan summarizes it well uh

comma slogan is make driving chill

i love it okay yeah i mean it is

you know if you like cruise control

imagine cruise control but much much

more

so it can uh do adaptive cruise control

things which is like slow down for cars

in front of it maintain a certain speed

and you can also do lane keeping so

staying in the lane

and doing it better and better and

better over time that's very much

machine learning based

so this camera is there's a driver

facing camera

too that's

um what else is there what am i thinking

so the hardware versus software so

open pilot versus the actual hardware of

the device

what's can you draw that distinction

what's one what's the other i mean the

hardware is pretty much

a cell phone with a few additions a cell

phone with a cooling system

and with a car interface connecting to

it

and as by cell phone you mean uh like

qualcomm snapdragon

uh yeah the current hardware is a

snapdragon 821

uh it has wi-fi radio it has an lte

radio it has a screen

uh we use every part of the cell phone

and then the interface of the car is

specific to the car so you keep

supporting more and more cars

um yeah so the interface to the car i

mean the device itself just has four can

buses

has four cam interfaces on it that are

connected through the usb port to the

phone

um and then yeah on those four can buses

uh you connect it to the car and there's

a little harness to do this

cars are actually surprisingly similar

so can is the the protocol by which cars

communicate

and then you're able to read stuff and

write stuff to be able to control the

car

depending on the car so what's the

software side what's open pilot

um so i mean open pilot is the hardware

is pretty simple compared to open pilot

open pilot is

uh well

so you have a machine learning model

which it's an open pilot it's a

you know it's a blob it's just a blob of

weights it's not like people are like oh

it's closed source i'm like it's a blob

of weights what do you expect

um you know primarily neural network

based

ul open pilot is all the software kind

of around that neural network that if

you have a neural network that says

here's where you want to send the car

openpilot actually goes and executes all

of that

it cleans up the input to the neural

network it cleans up the output and

executes on it so it connects

it's the glue that connects everything

together runs the sensors does a bunch

of calibration for the neural network

does you know deals with like you know

if the car is on a banked road

uh you have to counter steer against

that and the neural network can't

necessarily know that by looking at the

picture

so you do that with with other sensors

infusion and localizer

openpilot also is responsible for

sending the data up to our servers so we

can learn from it

logging it recording it running the

cameras thermally managing the device

managing the disk space on the device

managing all the resources of the device

so what um since we last spoke i don't

remember when maybe a year ago maybe a

little bit longer

how uh has open pilot improved we did

exactly what i promised you

i promised you that by the end of the

year you'd be able to remove the lanes

um the lateral policy is now

uh almost completely end to end you can

turn the lanes off and it will drive

drive slightly worse on the highway if

you turn the lanes off but you can turn

the lanes off and it will drive

well trained completely end to end on

user data

um and this year we hope to do the same

for the longitudinal policy so that's

the interesting thing

is you're not doing you don't appear to

be you can correct me you don't appear

to be doing lean

detection or lane marking detection or

kind of the segmentation task or

any kind of object detection task you're

doing what's

traditionally more called like

end-to-end learning

so and trained on actual behavior of

drivers

when they're driving the car manually

and this is hard to do you know it's not

supervised learning

yeah but uh so the nice thing is there's

a lot of data so it's hard and easy

right it's uh we have a lot of high

quality data yeah

like more than you need in the senate

well we way more than we do we have way

more data than we need

i mean it's it's an interesting question

actually because

in terms of amount you have more than

you need

but the you know driving is full of edge

cases so how do you

select the data you train on

i i think this is an interesting open

question like what's

what's the cleverest way to select data

that's the question tesla is probably

working on

uh that's i mean the entirety of machine

learning can be they don't seem to

really care they just kind of select

data but i feel like that

if you want to solve if you want to

create intelligent systems you have to

pick data well

right and so would you have any hints

ideas of how to do it well

so in some ways that is the definition i

like of reinforcement learning versus

supervised learning

in supervised learning the weights

depend on the data

right um and this is obviously true but

the

uh in reinforcement learning the data

depends on the weights

yeah right and actually both ways that's

that's poetry

so it's brilliant how does it know what

data to turn on well let it pick

we're not there yet but that's the

eventual so you're thinking this

almost like a reinforcement learning

framework we're going to do rl on the

world

every time a car makes a mistake user

disengages we

train on that and do our all in the

world ship out a new model that's an

epoch right

and uh for now you're not

doing the elon style promising that it's

going to be fully autonomous you really

are sticking to level two

and like it's supposed to be supervised

oh it is definitely supposed to be

supervising reinforced the fact that

it's supervised

um we look at our rate of improvement

in disengagements um open pilot now has

an unplanned engagement about every 100

miles

this is up from 10 miles like

maybe maybe uh

maybe a year ago yeah so maybe we've

seen 10x improvement in a year but

a hundred miles is still a far cry from

the hundred thousand you're going to

need

so you're going to somehow need to get

um

three more 10xs in there and your

what's your intuition uh you're

basically hoping that there's

exponential improvement built into the

baked into the cake somewhere well

that's even like i mean 10x improvement

that's already assuming exponential

right there's definitely exponential

improvement and i think when elon talks

about exponential like

these things these systems are going to

exponentially improve

just exponential doesn't mean you're

getting 100 gigahertz processors

tomorrow

right like it's going to still take a

while because the gap

between even our best system and humans

is still large

so that's an interesting distinction to

draw so if you look at the way tesla's

approaching the problem

and the way you're approaching the

problem which is very different than the

rest of the

self-driving car world so let's put them

aside

is you're treating most the driving task

is a machine learning problem

and the way tesla is approaching it is

with the multi-task learning

where you break the task of driving into

hundreds of different desks

and you have this multi-headed neural

network that's very good at

performing each task and there there's

presumably something on top that's

stitching stuff together in order to uh

make controlled decisions policy

decisions about how you move the car

but what that allows you there's a

brilliance to this because it allows you

to

um master each task like

lane detection uh stop sign detection

traffic light detection uh drivable area

segmentation

uh you know vehicle bicycle pedestrian

detection

uh there's some localization tasks in

there

also predicting of

like yeah predicting how the the

entities in the scene are going to move

like everything is basically a machine

learning task well there's a

classification

segmentation prediction and

it's nice because you can have this

entire engine data engine that's mining

for edge cases

for each one of these tasks and you can

have people like engineers that are

basically masters of that task

like becoming the best person in the

world that uh as you talk about the cone

guy

for uh for for waymo the good old phone

guy

the the becoming the best person in the

world at uh at uh

at cone detection i i so that's a

compelling notion from a supervised

learning perspective

automating much of the process of

educates discovery and retraining neural

network for each of the individual

perception tasks and then you're looking

at the machine learning

in a more holistic way basically doing

end-to-end learning

on the driving task supervised trained

on the data of the actual

driving of people that use comma ai

like actual human drivers do manual

control plus the

moments of disengagement that uh

maybe with some labeling could indicate

the failure of the system so you have

the

you have a huge amount of data for

positive

control of the vehicle like successful

control of the vehicle

both maintaining the lane as as i think

you're also working on

longitudinal control of the vehicle and

then failure cases where the vehicle

does something

wrong that needs disengagement

so like what why do you think you're

right and tesla is wrong

on this and do you think do you think

you'll come around the tesla way do you

think tesla will come around

to your way if you were to start a chess

engine company

would you hire a bishop guy see we have

uh this is monday morning quarterbacking

as uh yes probably

[Laughter]

so oh oh our rook guy oh we stole the

rook guy from that company oh we're

gonna have real good

rooks well there's not many pieces right

you can uh yeah there's not many

guys and gals to hire you just have a

few that work on the bishop a few that

work in the rook

but is that not ludicrous today to think

about in in the world of alpha zero

but alpha zero is jessica so the the

fundamental question

is how hard is driving compared to chess

because so long term end to end

will be the right solution the question

is how many years away is that

end-to-end is going to be the only

solution for level five for the only way

we can

of course and of course tesla's gonna

come around to my way and if you're a

rook guy out there i'm sorry

the cone guy i don't know we're gonna

specialize each task we're gonna really

understand

rook placement yeah i understand the

intuition you have

i mean that

that uh is very compelling notion that

we can learn the task and to end

like the same compelling notion you

might have for natural language

conversation

i'm not sure

because one thing you sneaked in there

is the assertion that

it's impossible to get to level five

without this kind of approach

i don't know if that's obvious i don't

know if that's obvious either i don't

actually uh mean that i think that it is

much easier

to get to level five with an end-to-end

approach i think that the other approach

is

doable but the magnitude of the

engineering challenge may exceed what

humanity is capable of

so but what do you think of the tesla

data engine approach which to me is an

active learning task is kind of

fascinating

is breaking it down into these multiple

tasks and

mining their data constantly for like

edge cases

for these different tasks but the tasks

themselves are not being learned this is

feature engineering

yeah i mean it's it's a it's a higher

abstraction level of feature engineering

for the different tasks

it's task engineering in a sense it's

slightly better feature engineering but

it still fundamentally is feature

engineering

and anything about the history of ai has

taught us anything

it's that feature engineering approaches

will always be replaced and lose

to end to end now to be fair i cannot

really make promises on timelines

but i can say that when you look at the

code for stockfish and the code for

alpha zero

one is a lot shorter than the other a

lot more elegant required a lot less

programmer hours to write

yeah but there was a lot more murder

of bad uh

agents on the uh alpha zero side

by murder i mean uh agents that played a

game and failed miserably

yeah oh in simulation that failure is

less costly yeah in in real world it's

wait do you mean in practice like alpha

zero has lost games miserably

no well i haven't seen that no but i

know but the the

the the requirement for alpha zero is a

simulator

to be able to like evolution human

evolution

not human evolution biological evolution

of life on earth from the origin of life

has murdered trillions upon trillions of

organisms

on the path to us humans yeah so the

question is can

can we uh stitch together a human-like

object without having to go through the

entirety process of evolution

well no but do the evolution in

simulation yeah that's the question can

we simulate so do you have a sense

that's possible to simulate some

mu zero is exactly this mu zero is

is the solution to this mu zero i think

is going to look be looked back

as the canonical paper and i don't think

deep learning is everything i think that

there's still a bunch of things missing

to get there

but mu zero i think is going to be

looked back as the kind of cornerstone

paper

um of this whole deep learning era

and mu zero is the solution to

self-driving cars you have to make a few

tweaks to it

but mu0 does effectively that it does

those roll outs

and those murdering in in a learned

simulator in a learned dynamics model

it's interesting it doesn't get enough

love i was blown away when i i was blown

away when i read that paper i'm like

you know okay i've always had a comma

i'm gonna sit and i'm gonna wait for the

solution to self-driving cars to come

along

this year i saw it it's me zero yeah

so uh sit back and let the winning roll

in

so your sense just to elaborate a little

bit

to link on the topic your senses in your

networks will solve driving

yes like we don't need anything else i

think the same way chess was maybe the

chess and maybe google are the pinnacle

of like

search algorithms and things that look

kind of like a star

um the pinnacle of

this era is going to be self-driving

cars

but on the path of that you have to

deliver products

and it's possible that the path to full

self-driving cars

will take decades i doubt it so how long

would you put on it

like what what are we you're chasing it

tesla's chasing it what are we talking

about five years 10 years

50 years in the 2020s in the 2020s

the later part of the 2020s

with the neural network well that would

be nice to see and on the path to that

you're delivering products

which is a nice l2 system that's what

tesla's doing a nice l2 system i'm just

going to do better every time

l2 the only difference between l2 and

the other levels is who takes liability

and

i'm not a liability guy i want to take

liability level 2 forever

now on that little transition i mean

how do you make the transition work is

uh is this where driver sensing

comes in like how do you make the

because you said

100 miles like is is there some

sort of human factor psychology thing

where people start to over trust the

system all those kinds of

effects once it gets better and better

and better and better they get lazier

and lazier and lazier

is that like how do you get that

transition right first off our

monitoring is already adaptive

our monitoring is already seen adaptive

driver monitoring

is this the camera that's looking at the

driver you have an infrared camera

in the our policy for

how we enforce the driver monitoring is

scene adaptive what's that mean

well for example in one of the extreme

cases um

if you uh if the car is not moving we do

not

uh actively enforce driver monitor right

um if you are going through a

uh like a 45 mile an hour road with

lights

um and stop signs and potentially

pedestrians we enforce a very tight

driver monitoring policy

if you are alone on a perfectly straight

highway

um and this is it's all machine learning

none of that is hand coded

actually the stop is hand coded but so

there's some kind of machine learning

estimation of risk yes yeah i mean i've

always been a huge fan of that that

that's uh because it's difficult to do

every step into that direction

is a worthwhile step to take it might be

difficult to do really well like us

humans are able to

estimate risk pretty damn well whatever

the hell that is

that feels like one of the nice features

of us humans

uh because like we humans are really

good drivers when we're really like

tuned in and we're good at estimating

risk like when are we supposed to be

tuned in

yeah and you know people are like oh

well you know why would you ever make

the driver monitoring policy

less aggressive why would you always not

keep it at its most aggressive

because then people are just going to

get fatigued from it yes when they get

annoyed

you want them yeah you they want you

want the experience to be pleasant

obviously i want the experience to be

pleasant but even just from a straight

up safety perspective

if you alert people when they look

around and they're like

why is this thing alerting me there's

nothing i could possibly hit right now

people will just learn to tune it out

people will just learn to tune it out to

put weights on the steering wheel to do

whatever to overcome it

and remember that you're always part of

this adaptive system so

all i can really say about you know how

this scale is going forward is yeah

something we have to monitor for

we don't know this is a great psychology

experiment at scale like we'll see

yeah it's fascinating track it and

making sure you have a good

understanding of attention is a very key

part of that psychology problem

yeah i think i mean you and i probably

have a different come to it differently

but to me

it's an it's a fascinating psychology

problem to explore something much deeper

than just driving

it's a it's such a nice way to explore

human

attention and human behavior

which is why again we've probably both

criticized

mr elon musk on this one topic from

different

avenues uh so both offline and online i

had little chats with elon and

like i love human beings as a as a

as a computer vision problem as an ai

problem it's fascinating

he wasn't so much interested in that

problem

it's like in order to solve driving the

whole point is you want to remove the

human from the picture

and it seems like you can't do that

quite yet eventually yes but

you can't quite do that yet so

this is the moment where and you can't

yet say

i told you so uh to tesla

but it's getting there because i don't

know if you've seen this there's some

reporting that they're in fact starting

to do

drive them off yeah they ship the model

in shadow mode

uh without uh i believe only a visible

light camera it might even be fisheye

uh it's like a low resolution low

resolution visible light

i mean to be fair that's what we have in

the eon as well our last generation

product

this is the one area where i can say our

hardware's ahead of tesla the rest of

our hardware way way behind but our

driver monitoring camera

do you think uh i think on the

third row tesla podcast or somewhere

else i've heard you say that

obviously eventually they're gonna have

driver monitoring

i think what i've said is elon will

definitely ship driver monitoring before

he ships level five the beautiful level

and i'm willing to about 10 grand on

that and you better ground on that

uh i mean now i want to take the bet but

before maybe someone would have i should

have got my money

yeah that's an interesting bet i think i

i think you're right i'm actually

on a human level because he's been

he's made the decision like he said that

driver monitoring is the wrong way to go

but like you have to think of as a human

as a ceo

i think that's the right thing to say

when like

sometimes you have to say things

publicly they're different than when you

actually believe

because when you're producing a large

number of vehicles

and the decision was made not to include

the camera like what are you supposed to

say

yeah like our cars don't have the thing

that i think is right to have

uh it's an interesting thing but like on

the other side as a ceo i mean something

you could probably speak to

as a leader i think about me as a human

to publicly change your mind on

something how hard is that

well especially when like

george haas say i told you so

all i will say is i am not a leader and

i am happy to change my mind

um and i think elon will

yeah i do i think he'll come up with a

good way to

make it psychologically okay for him

well

it's such an important thing man

especially for a first principles

thinker because he made a decision

that uh driver monitoring is not the

right way to go and i could see that

decision

and i i could even make that decision

like i was on the fence

too like i'm not driving monitoring

is such an obvious simple solution to

the problem of attention

it's not obvious to me that just by

putting a camera there you solve

things you have to create an

incredible compelling experience just

like you're you're talking about

and i don't know if it's easy to do that

it's not at all easy to do that in fact

i think

so as a creator of a car that's trying

to

create a product that people love which

is what tesla tries to do right

it's not obvious to me that uh you know

as a design decision whether adding a

camera

is a good idea from a safety perspective

either like

in the human factors community everybody

says

that like you should obviously have

driver sensing driving monitoring

but like that

that's like saying it's obvious as

parents you shouldn't let your kids go

out at night

but okay but like

they're still gonna find ways to do

drugs

yeah you have to also be good parents so

like it's it's much more complicated

than just like

you need to have drive and monitoring i

totally disagree on

okay if you have a camera there and the

camera's watching the person

but never throws an alert they'll never

think about it

right the the driver monitoring policy

that you choose to how you choose to

communicate with the user is

entirely separate from the data

collection perspective right

right so you know like

there's one thing to say like you know

tell your teenager they can't do

something

there's another thing to like you know

gather the data so you can

make informed decisions that's really

interesting but you have to make that

that's the interesting thing about cars

uh but even true with com ai

like you don't have to manufacture the

thing into the car

is you have to make a decision that

anticipates

the right strategy long term so like you

have to start collecting the data

and start making decisions starter date

started it three years ago

i believe that we have the best driver

monitoring solution in the world

um i think that when you compare it to

well supercruise is the only other one

that i really know that shipped

and ours is better what uh

what do you like and not like about

super coos um i mean i had a few

super crews uh the sun would be shining

through the window

would blind the camera and it would say

i wasn't paying attention when i was

looking completely straight

i couldn't reset the attention with a

steering wheel touch and supercrews

would disengage

like i was communicating to the car i'm

like look i'm here i'm paying attention

why are you really gonna force me to

disengage and

it did um so it's it's a constant

conversation with the user and yeah

there's no way to ship a system like

this if you can ota

right we're shipping a new one every

month sometimes we we

balance it with our users on discord

like when sometimes we make the driver

monitoring a little more aggressive and

people complain

sometimes they don't you know we want it

to be as aggressive as possible where

people

don't complain it doesn't feel intrusive

so being able to update the system over

the air is an essential component

i mean that's probably to me you

mentioned uh

i mean to me that is the biggest

innovation of tesla

that it it made it people realize that

over-the-air updates

is essential yeah i mean

yeah was that not obvious from the

iphone the iphone was the first real

product that ota'ed i think

was it actually that's that's brilliant

you're right i mean the game consoles

used to not right

the game consoles are maybe the second

thing that did well i didn't really

think about

one of the amazing features of a

smartphone

isn't just like the touchscreen isn't

the thing

it's the ability to constantly update

yeah

get better it gets better

i love my ios 14. uh

one thing that i probably disagree with

you on on driving monitoring

is you've said that it's easy like i

mean you you tend to say stuff is easy

the uh i guess you said it's easy

relative to the

external perception problem

can you elaborate why you think it's

easy feature engineering works

for driver monitoring feature

engineering does not work for the

external

so human faces are not

human faces and the movement of human

faces and head

and body is not as variable as the

external environment

is your intuition um yes and there's

another big difference as well um your

reliability of a driver monitoring

system

doesn't actually need to be that high

the uncertainty

if you have something that's detecting

whether the human is paying attention it

only works 92

of the time you're still getting almost

all the benefit of that because

the human like you're training the human

yeah right you're you're dealing with a

system that's

really helping you out it's a

conversation it's not

like the external thing where guess what

if you swerve into a tree you swerve

into a tree

right like you get no margin for error

yeah i think that's really well put i

i i think that's the right exactly the

place

where um where comparing to the external

perception the control problem

driver monitoring is easier because you

know the bar for success is much lower

yeah but i i still think like the human

face

is more complicated actually than the

external environment but for driving you

don't give a damn

i don't need you i don't need something

i don't need something that complicated

to to to have to communicate the idea

to the human that i want to communicate

which is yo

system might mess up here you got to pay

attention

yeah see that's that's my love and

fascination is the

the human face and it feels like this is

a nice place to um create products that

create an experience in the car

so like it feels like there should be

more richer experiences

in the car you know like that's an

opportunity for

like something like my eye or just any

kind of system like a tesla or any of

the autonomous vehicle companies

is because software's and there's much

more sensors

and so much is running on software and

you're doing machine learning anyway

there's an opportunity to create totally

new experiences

that we're not even anticipating you

don't think so

no you think it's a box that gets you

from a to b and you want to do it

chill yeah i mean i think as soon as we

get to level three on highways okay

enjoy your candy crush

enjoy your hulu enjoy your

you know whatever whatever sure you get

this you can look at screens basically

versus right now what do you have music

and audio books so level three is where

you can kind of disengage in

in stretches of time

[Music]

[Applause]

well you think level three is possible

like on the highway going for 100 miles

and you can just go to sleep oh yeah

uh sleep so again

i think it's really all on a spectrum i

think that

being able to use your phone while

you're on the highway

and like this all being okay and being

aware that the car might alert you and

you have five seconds to basically

so the five second thing that you think

is possible yeah i think it is oh yeah

not not in all scenarios right some

scenarios it's not

it's the whole risk thing that you

mentioned is nice is to be able to

estimate like

how risky is this situation exactly

that's really important to understand

one other thing you mentioned comparing

comma and

autopilot is that um

something about the haptic feel of the

way combo controls the car

when things are uncertain like it

behaves a little bit more uncertain when

things are uncertain

that's kind of an interesting point and

then autopilot is much more confident

always even when it's uncertain until it

runs into trouble

yeah that's that's a funny thing i

actually mentioned that to elon i think

and then the first time we talked he

wasn't biting

is like communicating uncertainty i

guess comet doesn't really communicate

uncertainty explicitly communicates it

through haptic feel

like what what's the role of

communicating uncertainty do you think

oh we do some stuff explicitly like we

do detect the lanes when you're on the

highway and we'll show you how many

lanes we're using to drive with

you can look at where it thinks the

lanes are you can look at um

the path and yeah we want to be better

about this we're actually hiring

i want to hire some new ui people ui

people you mentioned this because it's

such an

it's a ui problem too right it's we're

we have a great designer now

but you know we need people who are just

gonna like build this and debug these

uis

qt people and okay is that what the ui

has done with this key

we're moving the new ui is in qt c plus

plus qt

uses it yeah we had some react stuff in

there

react js would just react react is his

own language right

react native reaction react to the

javascript framework

yeah it's all it's all based on

javascript but it's

you know i like c plus plus

what do you think about uh dojo with

tesla

and their foray into what appears to be

specialized hardware for uh training

neonets

i guess it's something maybe you can

correct me from my

shallow looking at it it seems like

something like google did with tpus but

specialized

for uh driving data i don't think it's

specialized for driving data

it's just legit just tpu they want to

inter go the apple way basically

everything required in the chain is done

in-house well so you have a problem

right now and

this is one of my one of my concerns i

really would like to see

somebody deal with this if anyone out

there is doing it i'd like to help them

if i can

um you basically have two options right

now to train

your options are nvidia or google

so google is not even an option

their tpus are only available in google

cloud

google has absolutely onerous terms of

service restrictions

uh they may have changed it but back in

google's terms of service it said

explicitly you are not allowed to use

google cloud ml

for training autonomous vehicles or for

doing anything that competes with google

without google's prior written

permission

well okay i mean google is not a

platform company

uh i wouldn't i wouldn't touch tpus with

a 10-foot pole

so that leaves you with the monopoly uh

nvidia and video

so i mean that you're not a fan of well

look i was a huge fan of in 2016 nvidia

jensen came sat in the car um

cool guy when the stock was 30 a share

uh nvidia stock has skyrocketed i

witnessed a real

change in who was in management over

there in like 2018

and now they are let's exploit let's

take every dollar we possibly can out of

this ecosystem

let's charge ten thousand dollars for

a100s because we know we got the best

 in the game

and let's charge ten thousand dollars

for an a100

when it's really not that different from

3080 which is 699.

um the margins that they are making off

of those high-end chips are

so high that i mean i think they're

shooting themselves in the foot just

from a business perspective

because there's a lot of people talking

like me now who are like somebody's got

taken video down

yeah where they could dominate it nvidia

could be the new intel

yeah to be in inside everything

essentially

and and yet the winners in in certain

spaces like

autonomous driving the winners only the

people who are like

desperately falling back and trying to

catch up and have a ton of money

like the big automakers are the ones

interested in partnering with nvidia

oh and then i think a lot of those

things are going to fall through if i

were nvidia

sell chips sell chips at a reasonable

markup

to everybody to everybody without any

restrictions without any restrictions

intel did this look at intel they had a

great long run

nvidia is trying to turn their they're

like trying to productize their chips

way too much they're trying to extract

way more value than they can sustainably

sure you can do it tomorrow is it going

to up your share price sure if you're

one of those ceos

like how much can i strip mine this

company and you know and that's what's

weird about it too

like the ceo is the founder it's the

same guy yeah i mean i still think

jensen's a great guy that's great why do

this

you have a choice you have a choice

right now are you trying to cash out are

you trying to buy a yacht

if you are fine but if you're trying to

be

the next huge semiconductor company sell

chips

well the the interesting thing about

jensen is he is

a big vision guy so he has

a plan like for 50 years down the road

so it makes me wonder like how does

price gouging fit into it yeah how does

that

like it's it doesn't seem to make sense

to plan

i worry that he's listening to the wrong

people yeah that that's the sense i have

too sometimes because i despite

everything

i think nvidia is an incredible company

well one

sort of i'm deeply grateful to nvidia

for the products they've created me to

pass right

and so the 1080 ti was a great gpu still

have a lot of them

it was yeah but

at the same time it just feels like

feels like you don't want to put all

your stock in nvidia and so like elon

is doing um what tesla is doing with

autopilot and dojo

is the apple way is because they're not

going to share dojo with uh george hotz

uh

i i know they should sell that chip

oh they should sell their even their

their accelerator the accelerator that's

in all the cars the 30 watt one

sell it why not so open it up

make me why does this have to be a car

company

well if you sell the chip here's what

you get yeah

make some money off the chips it doesn't

take away from your chip

you're going to make some money free

money and also

the world is going to build an ecosystem

of tooling for you

right you're not going to have to fix

the bug in your tanh layer

someone else already did well the

question that's an interesting question

i mean that's the

question steve jobs asked that's the

question elon musk is

uh perhaps asking is uh

do you want tesla stuff inside other

vehicles in

inside potentially inside like uh irobot

vacuum cleaner

yeah i think you should decide where

your advantages are

i'm not saying tesla should start

selling battery packs to automakers

because battery packs to automakers they

are straight up in competition with you

if i were tesla i'd keep the battery

technology totally yeah ssr's we make

batteries

but the thing about the tesla tpu um

is anybody can build that it's just a

question of you know

are you willing to spend the you know

the money it could be a huge source of

revenue potentially

are you willing to spend 100 million

dollars right anyone can build it

and someone will and a bunch of

companies now are starting trying to

build ai accelerators somebody's going

to get the idea right

and yeah hopefully they don't get greedy

because they'll just lose to the next

guy who finally and then eventually the

chinese are going to make knock off and

video chips and that's

from your perspective i don't know if

you're also paying attention to stan

tesla for a moment

all dave elon musk has talked about a

complete rewrite

of uh the neural net that they're using

that seems to

again i'm half paying attention but it

seems to involve

basically a kind of integration of all

the sensors to where

it's a four dimensional view you know

you have a 3d

model of the world over time and then

you can i think it's done

both for the for actually you know

so the neural network is able to in a

more holistic way deal with the world

and make predictions and so on

but also to make the annotation task

more uh

you know easier like you can annotate

the world

in one place and then kind of distribute

itself across the sensors and

across a different like the hundreds of

tasks that are involved

in the hydronet what are your thoughts

about this rewrite is it just like some

details

that are kind of obvious there are steps

that should be taken or is there

something fundamental

that could challenge your idea that end

to end is the right solution

uh we're in the middle of a bakery right

now as well we haven't shipped a new

model in a bit

of what kind uh we're going from 2d to

3d

right now all our stuff like for example

when the car pitches back the lane lines

also pitch back

uh because we're assuming the flat ro

flat world hypothesis

uh the new models do not do this the new

models output everything in 3d

um so this but there's still no

annotation so the 3d is

it's more about the opposite yeah uh

we have we have disease and everything

uh we've disease

yeah we had a disease we had a disease

um we unified

a lot of stuff as well uh we switched

from tensorflow to pi torch

yes uh my understanding

of what tesla's thing is is that their

annotator now annotates across the time

dimension

uh i mean cute

why are you building an annotator i i

find their entire pipeline

i find your vision i mean the vision

event to end

very compelling but i also like the

engineering of the data engine that

they've created

in terms of supervised learning

pipelines

that thing is damn impressive you're

basically the

the idea is that you have hundreds of

thousands of people that are doing data

collection for you by doing their

experience so that's kind of similar to

the common ai model

and you're able to

mine that data based on the kind of edge

cases you need

i i think it's harder to do in the end

to end learning

the mining of the right edge cases like

that's where feature engineering

is actually really powerful because

like us humans are able to do this kind

of mining a little better but but

yeah there's obvious as we as we know

there's obvious constraints and

limitations to that

idea uh carpathi just tweeted he's like

um

you get really interesting insights if

you saw if you sort your validation set

by loss

and look at the highest loss examples

yeah

uh so yeah i mean you can do we we have

we have a little data engine like thing

we're training a segment uh

it's not fancy it's just like okay train

the new segment

run it on 100 000 images and now take

the thousand with highest loss

select 100 of those by human put those

get those ones labeled

retrain do it again right so it's a much

less well-written data engine and yeah

you can you can take these things really

far and it is

impressive engineering and if you truly

need supervised data for a problem

yeah things like data engine are the

high end of the

what is attention is a human paying

attention i mean we're going to probably

build something that looks like data

engine to push our driver monitoring

further

um but for driving itself you have it

all annotated beautifully

by what the human does so yeah that's

interesting i mean that applies to

driver

attention as well do you want to detect

the eyes do you want to detect blinking

and pupil movement

do you want to detect all the like face

alignments the landmark detection and so

on

and then doing kind of reasoning based

on that or do you want to take the

entirety of the face over time and

do and i mean it's obvious that over

eventually you have to do end to end

with some calibration with some fixes

and so on

but it's uh like i don't know when

that's the right move

even if it's end to end there actually

is there is no

kind of um you have to supervise that

with humans

whether a human is paying attention or

not is a completely subjective judgment

um like you can try to like

automatically do it with some stuff but

you don't

have if i record a video of a human i

don't have

true annotations anywhere in that video

the only way to get them

is with you know other humans labeling

it really

well i don't know uh you you so

if you think deeply about it you could

you might be able to just depending on

the task maybe you'll discover

self-annotating things like

you know you can look at like steering

wheel reversal or something like that

you can discover little moments of lapse

of attention yeah

i mean that's that's where psychology

comes in

is there indicate because you have so so

much data to look at

so you might be able to find moments

when there's like just

inattention that even with smartphone if

you want to detect smartphone use

yeah you can start to zoom in i mean

that's the gold mine

sort of the comma ai i mean tesla's

doing this too right is there they're

doing

annotation based on it's like uh

self-supervised

learning too it's just a small part of

the entire picture

it's that's kind of the challenge

of solving a problem in machine learning

if you can discover

self-annotating parts of the problem

right our driver monitoring team is half

a person right now i have a problem

you know once we have skill to full once

we have two people once we have two

three people on that team

i definitely want to look at

self-annotating stuff or yeah for

attention

let's go back for a sec to uh to a comma

and how what you know for people who are

curious to try it out

how do you install a comma in say a 2020

toyota corolla

or like what are the cars that are

supported what are the cars that you

recommend

and what does it take you have a few

videos out but maybe through words can

you explain

what's it take to actually install a

thing so we support uh i think it's 91

cars

91 makes models um we get to 100 this

year

nice the yeah the

2020 corolla great choice

the um 2020 sonata uh it's using the

stock longitudinal it's using just our

lateral control

but it's a very refined car their

longitudinal control is not

bad at all um so yeah corolla

sonata or if you're willing to get your

hands a little dirty and look in the

right places on the internet the honda

civic is great

uh but you're going to have to install a

modified eps firmware

in order to get a little bit more torque

and i can't help you with that comma

does not officially endorse that

um but we have been doing it we didn't

ever release it

uh we waited for someone else to

discover it and then you know

and you have a discord server where

people there's a very active

developer community yeah as opposed to

so

depending on the level of

experimentation you're willing to

to do that's the community if you

if you just want to buy it and you have

a supported car yeah it's

10 minutes to install there's youtube

videos it's

ikea furniture level if you can set up a

table from ikea

you can install a comma 2 in your

supported car and it will just work

now you're like oh but i want this

high-end feature or i want to fix this

bug

okay well welcome to the developer

community uh

so what if i wanted to this is something

i asked you offline

or like a few months ago if i wanted to

run my own code

to um so use comma as a

platform and try to run something like

open pilot

what does it take to do that um so

there's a toggle in the settings called

enable ssh

and if you toggle that you can ssh into

your device you can modify the code you

can upload whatever code you want to it

um there's a whole lot of people so

about 60 of people are running stock

comma

about 40 percent of people are running

forks and there's a community

of there's a bunch of people who

maintain these forks and these forks

support

different cars or they have you know uh

different toggles

we try to keep away from the toggles

that are like disabled driver monitoring

but

you know there's some people might want

that kind of thing and like you know

yeah you can it's your car it's your

i'm not here to tell you you know

uh we we have some you know we ban

if you're trying to subvert safety

features you're banned from our discord

i don't want anything to do with you

but there's some forks doing that you

got it

so you encourage responsible uh forking

yeah yeah some people you know yeah some

people uh like like there's forks that

will do

um some people just like having a lot of

uh readouts on the ui like a lot of like

flashing numbers so there's forks that

do that

uh some people don't like the fact that

it disengages when you press the gas

pedal there's forks that disable that

got it now the the stock experience is

is what

like so it does both lane keeping and

longitudinal control

all together so it's not separate like

it is an autopilot

no so okay um some cars we use the stock

longitudinal control we don't do the

longitudinal control on all the cars

uh some cars the acc's are pretty good

in the cars it's the lane keep that's

atrocious in anything except for

autopilot super cruise

but you know you just turn it on and it

it works what does this engagement look

like yeah so we have i mean i'm very

concerned about mode confusion

i've experienced it on supercruise and

and autopilot where

like autopilot like autopilot disengages

i don't realize that the acc is still on

the lead car moves slightly over and

then the tesla accelerates to like

whatever my set speed is super fast and

like

what's going on here um we have

engaged and disengaged and this is

similar to my understanding i'm not a

pilot but my understanding is either the

pilot

is in control or the co-pilot is in

control

and we have the same kind of transition

system either open pilot is engaged or

open pilot is disengaged

engage with cruise control disengage

with either gas break or cancel

let's talk about money what's uh the

business strategy for comma

profitable well it's you're good

so congratulations yeah uh what uh

so basically selling so we should say

combo cost uh

a thousand bucks comment 200 for the

interface to the car as well it's 1200

all said done

nobody's usually up front like this yeah

you got it you got to have the tac

on right yeah i love it this side i'm

not going to lie to you

trust me it will add 1200 value to your

life yes

it's still super cheap 30 days no

questions asked money back guarantee and

prices are only going up you know if

there ever is future hardware

it could cost a lot more than twelve

hundred dollars so comma three is in the

works

so it could be all i will say is future

hardware is going to cost a lot more

than the current hardware

yeah like i mean the people that use uh

the people i've spoken with that use

comma

use open pilot they first of all they

use it a lot

so people that use it they they fall in

love with oh our retention rate is

insane

this is a good sign yeah it's a really

good sign um

70 of comma 2 buyers are daily active

users

yeah it's amazing

um oh also we don't plan on stopping

selling the comma too

like like it's you know so whatever you

create that's beyond comma two

it would be uh it would be potentially a

phase shift

like it's you it's so much better that

like you could use comma two and you can

use

comma depends what you want it's three

point four one kind of 42

yeah you know autopilot hardware one

versus hardware two yeah the comma two

is kind of like hardware one got it got

it

got it got it i think i heard you talk

about retention rate with the

vr headsets that the average is just

once yeah which is fast i mean it's such

a fascinating way to think about

technology

and this is a really really good sign

and the other thing that people say

about comm is like they can't believe

they're getting this for a thousand

bucks

right it's it seems it seems like a some

kind of steal

so but in terms of like long-term

business strategies it basically to

put so it's currently in like a thousand

plus cars

1200 more uh

so yeah dailies is about uh

dailies is about 2 000 weekly is about 2

500. monthlies is over 3 000.

wow we've grown a lot since we've

stopped

is the goal like can we talk crazy for a

second i mean what's the

goal to overtake tesla let's talk

okay so i mean android did overtake ios

yeah that's exactly it right so

yeah they did it i actually don't know

the timeline of that one

they but let let's talk uh

because everything is in alpha now the

autopilot you could argue is in alpha in

terms of

towards the big mission of autonomous

driving right and so

what yes your goal to overtake into

millions of cars

essentially of course where would it

stop

like it's open source software it might

not be millions of cars with a piece of

comma hardware but yeah

i think open pilot at some point

will cross over autopilot in in users

just like android crossed over ios

how does google make money from android

uh it's it's complicated their own

devices make money

google google makes money by just kind

of having you on the internet

uh yes google search is built in gmail

is built in

android is just a shill for the rest of

google's ecosystem yeah but the problem

is

android is not is a brilliant thing i

mean

android arguably changed the world so

there you go that's

you can you can feel good ethically

speaking but as a business strategy it's

questionable i'll sell hardware so

hardware i mean it took google a long

time to come around to it but they are

now making money on the pixel

you're not about money you're more about

winning yeah of course

but if only if only 10 percent of open

pilot devices

come from comma ai we still make a lot

that is still yes that is a ton of money

for our company but can't somebody

create

a better comma using open pilot or

you're basically saying well i'll

compete well i'll compete

is can you create a better android phone

than the google pixel right

i mean you can but like i love that so

you're confident

like you know what the hell you're doing

yeah it's

it's uh confidence in merit i mean our

money yeah our money comes from we're a

consumer electronics company

yeah and put it this way so we sold we

sold like three thousand company's

um i'm 2500 right now uh

and like

okay we're probably going to sell 10 000

units next year right 10 000 units

even just a thousand dollars a unit okay

we're 10 million in uh

in in in in revenue um get that up to a

hundred thousand

maybe double the price of the unit now

we're talking like 200 million in

revenue yeah

actually making money uh one of the rare

semi-autonomous or autonomous vehicle

companies that are actually making

money yeah yeah you know

if you have if you look at a model when

we were just talking about this

yesterday if you look at a model

and like you're testing like you're a b

testing your model and if you're you're

you're

one branch of the a b test the losses go

down very fast in the first five epochs

yeah

that model is probably going to converge

to something considerably better than

the one where the losses are going down

slower

why do people think this is going to

stop why do people think one day there's

going to be a great like

well waymo's eventually going to surpass

you guys

no they're not you see like a world

where like

a tesla or a car like a tesla would be

able to

basically press a button and you like

switch to open pilot

you know you know they load in i don't

know so

i think so first off i think that we may

surpass tesla

in terms of users uh i do not think

we're gonna surpass tesla ever in terms

of revenue

i think tesla can capture a lot more

revenue per user than we can

um but this mimics the android ios model

exactly

there may be more android devices but

you know there's a lot more iphones than

google pixels

so i think there'll be a lot more tesla

cars sold than pieces of comma hardware

um and then as far as a

tesla owner being able to switch to open

pilot

uh does ios does iphones run android

no but you can if you really want to do

it but it doesn't really make sense like

it's not

it doesn't make sense who cares what

about if uh a large company like

automakers 4g m toyota came to george

hotz or

on the tech space amazon facebook google

came with a large pile of cash

would would you consider being

purchased

do you see that as a one possible not

seriously now

um i would probably uh

see how much uh they'll entertain

for me

um and if they're willing to like jump

through a bunch of my hoops then maybe

but like no not the way that m a works

today i mean we've been approached

and i laugh in these people's faces i'm

like are you kidding me

yeah you know because you're so it's so

it's so demeaning the m a people are

so demeaning to companies they treat the

startup world

as their innovation ecosystem and they

think that i'm cool with going along

with that

so i can have some of their scam fake

fed dollars you know fedcoin i don't

what am i gonna do with more fedcoin you

know i had coin fat coin man

i love that so that's the cool thing

about podcasting actually is uh

people criticize i don't know if you're

familiar with the spotify

uh giving joe rogan a hundred million

and something about that

and you know they respect

despite all the that people are

talking about spotify

people understand that podcasters like

joe rogan

know what the hell they're doing yeah so

they give them money

and say just do what you do and

like the equivalent for you would be

like

george do what the hell you do because

you're good at it try not to murder too

many people

like try like there's some kind of

common sense things like

just don't go on a weird rampage of

yeah it comes down to what companies i

could respect

right um you know could i respect gm

never

um no i couldn't i mean could i respect

like

a hyundai more so right that's that's a

lot closer toyota

what's your nah nah it's korean is the

way

i think i think that you know the

japanese the germans the us they're all

too

they're all too you know they all think

they're too great what about the tech

companies

apple apple is of the tech companies

that i could respect apple's the closest

yeah i mean i could never subscribe it

would be ironic

oh if uh if common ai is acquired by

apple

i mean facebook look i quit facebook 10

years ago because i didn't respect the

business model

um google has declined so fast in the

last five years

what are your thoughts about waymo as

present and future so let me let me see

let me start by saying something uh nice

which is uh

i've visited them a few times and i've

[Music]

have ridden in their cars and

the engineering that they're doing

both the research and the actual

development and the engineering they're

doing

and the scale they're actually achieving

by doing it all themselves

is really impressive and the the balance

of safety and innovation

and like the cars work

really well for the routes they drive

like they drive

fast which was very surprising to me

like it drives like

the speed limit or faster the speed

limit it goes

and it works really damn well and the

interface is nice and chandler arizona

yeah yeah yeah in challengers in a very

specific environment so

it i you know it gives me enough

material

in my mind to push back against the

madman of the world like

george hotz to be like

like because you kind of imply there's

zero probability they're going to win

yeah and and after i've used

after i've written in it to me it's not

zero oh it's not for technology reasons

bureaucracy no it's worse than that it's

actually for product reasons i think

oh you think they're just not capable of

creating an amazing product uh

no i think that the product that they're

building doesn't make sense

um so a few things uh you say the weimos

are fast

um benchmark away mo against a competent

uber driver

right right the uber driver is faster

it's not even about speed it's the thing

you said

it's about the experience of being stuck

at a stop sign

because pedestrians are crossing

non-stop

i like when my uber driver doesn't come

to a full stop at the stop sign yeah

you know and so

let's say the waymo's are 20 slower than

than an uber

right um you can argue they're going to

be cheaper

and i argue that users already have the

choice to trade off money for speed

it's called uberpool um i think it's

like 15

of rides or uber pools right users are

not willing to trade off

money for speed so the whole product

that they're building

is not going to be competitive with

traditional ride sharing networks

right um like and also

whether there's profit to be made

depends entirely on one company having a

monopoly

i think that the level for autonomous

ride sharing vehicles

market is going to look a lot like the

scooter market if even the technology

does come to exist which i question

who's doing well in that market yeah

it's a race to the bottom

you know well they could be it could be

closer like an uber and a lyft

where it's just a one or two players

well

the scooter people have given up trying

to market scooters

as a practical means of transportation

and they're just like

they're super fun to ride look at wheels

i love those things and they're great on

that front

yeah but from an actual transportation

product perspective

i do not think scooters are viable and i

do not think level 4 autonomous cars are

viable

if you uh let's play a fun experiment if

you

ran let's do a tesla and let's do waymo

if uh elon musk took a vacation for

a year he just said screw it i'm gonna

go live on an island

no electronics and the board decides

that we need to find somebody to run the

company

and they they decide that you should run

the company for a year

how do you run tesla differently i

wouldn't change much

do you think they're on the right track

i wouldn't change i mean i'd have some

minor changes but even even my debate

with tesla

about you know end to end versus segnets

like that's just software who cares

right

like it's not gonna it's not like you're

doing something terrible with segnats

you're probably building something

that's at least going to help you debug

the end-to-end system a lot

right it's very easy to transition from

what they have

to like an end-to-end kind of thing

and then i presume you would uh

in the model y or maybe in the model 3

start adding driver sensing with

infrared yes i would add i would

i would add infrared camera infrared

lights

right away to those cars um

and start collecting that data and do

all that kind of stuff yeah

very much i think they're already kind

of doing it it's it's an incredibly

minor change

if i actually were ceo of tesla first

off i'd be horrified that i wouldn't be

able to do a good job as elon

and then i would try to you know

understand the way he's done things

before he would also have to take over

his twitter

so god i don't tweet yeah what's your

twitter situation why

why why are you so quiet on twitter

comma is

like what what's your social network

presence like because you you

on instagram you're you're you uh you do

live streams you're

you're you're um you understand the

music of the internet

but you don't always fully engage into

it you're part-time i used to have a

twitter

yeah i mean it's the pr instagram is a

pretty place

instagram is a beautiful place it

glorifies beauty i like i like

instagram's values as a network

um twitter glorifies conflict glorifies

you know

like like like like like you know just

shots

taking shots at people and it's like you

know well

you know twitter and donald trump are

perfectly

they're perfect for each other so

tesla's on uh tesla's on the right track

in your view yeah

okay so let's try let's like really try

this experiment if you ran

way more let's say they're i don't know

if you agree but

they seem to be at the head of the pack

of the kind of

uh what would you call that approach

like it's not necessarily lighter based

because it's not about lighter but

before robot taxi

level four robot taxi all in before any

before making your revenue

uh so they're probably at the head of

the pack if you were

said hey george can you please run this

company for a year how would you

change it uh i would go i would get

anthony levandowski out of jail

and i would put him in charge of the

company

um let's try to break that apart

why do you do you want to make do you

want to destroy the company by doing

that or

do you mean or do you mean uh you like

renegade style thinking that uh pushes

that that like throws away bureaucracy

and goes to first principle thinking

what

what do you mean by that um i think

anthony lewandowski is a genius

and i think he would come up with a much

better idea of what to do with waymo

than me

so you mean that unironically he is a

genius oh yes oh absolutely

without a doubt i mean i'm not saying

there's no shortcomings

but in the interactions i've had with

him yeah

what um he's also willing to take like

who knows what he would do with waymo

i mean he's also out there like far more

out there than i am yeah there's big

risks

yeah what do you make of him i was i was

going to talk to him in this podcast and

i was going back and forth

i'm i'm such a gullible naive human like

i see the best in people

and i slowly started to realize that

there might be some people out there

that like have multiple faces to the

world

they're like deceiving and dishonest i

still

refuse to like i i just i trust people

and i don't care if i get hurt by it but

like

you know sometimes you have to be a

little bit careful especially platform

wise and

podcast wise what do you what am i

supposed to think

so you think you think he's a good

person

oh i don't know i don't really make

moral judgments

and it's difficult to oh oh i mean this

about the waymo actually i mean that

whole idea very non-ironically about

what i would do

the problem with putting me in charge of

waymo is waymo is already

10 billion dollars in the hull right

whatever idea waymo does look

com is profitable comes raised 8.1

million dollars that's small

you know that's small money like i can

build a reasonable consumer electronics

company

and succeed wildly at that and still

never be able to pay back weight most 10

billion

so i i think the basic idea with women

well forget the 10 billion because they

have some backing but

your basic thing is like what can we do

to stop making some money

well no i mean my bigger idea is like

whatever the idea is that's going to

save waymo

i don't have it it's going to have to be

a big risk idea and i cannot think of a

better person than anthony lewandowski

to do it

so that is completely what i would do as

ceo of waymo i call myself a

transitionary ceo

do everything i can to fix that

situation yeah

uh yeah cause i can't i can't do it

right like i can't i can't

oh i mean i can talk about how what i

really want to do is just apologize for

all those corny

uh you know ad campaigns and be like

here's the real state of the technology

yeah um like i have several criticism

i'm a little bit more bullish on

waymo than than you seem to be but

one criticism i have is it went into

corny mode too early

like it's still a startup it hasn't

delivered on anything so

it should be like more renegade and show

off the engineering that they're doing

which just can be impressive as opposed

to doing these weird commercials of like

your friendly yeah your friendly car

company

i mean that's my biggest my biggest

snipe at waymo was always that guy's a

paid actor

that guy's not a waymo user he's a paid

actor look here i found his call sheet

do kind of like what spacex is doing

with uh the rocket launchers just

get put the nerds up front put the

engineers up front and just like

show failures too just i love i love

spacex's

yeah yeah the thing they're doing is

right and it just

feels like the right but we're all so

excited to see them succeed

yeah i can't wait to see when it won't

fail you know like you lie to me i want

you to fail

you tell me the truth you'll be honest

with me i want you to succeed yeah

uh yeah and that requires the uh the

renegade ceo

right i'm with you i'm with you i still

have a little bit of faith in waymo to

for for the renegade ceo to step forward

but

it's not it's not john krafter yeah

it's uh you can't it's not chris

holmstone

and those people may be very good at

certain things yeah

but they're not renegades because these

companies are fundamentally even though

we're talking about billion dollars

all these crazy numbers they're still

like early stage startups

i mean i i just i if you are pre-revenue

and you've raised 10 billion dollars i

have no idea like

like this just doesn't work no it's

against everything silicon valley

where's your minimum viable product

you know where's your users what's your

growth numbers

this is traditional silicon valley why

do you not apply it to what you think

you're too big to fail already

like how do you think autonomous

driving will change society so the

mission is

for comma to uh solve

self-driving do you have like a vision

of the world of how

it'll be different

is it as simple as a to b transportation

or is there like

because these are robots it's not about

autonomous driving in and of itself it's

what the technology enables

it's i think it's the coolest applied ai

problem i like it because it has a clear

path to monetary value um

but as far as that being the thing that

changes the world

i mean no like like there's cute things

we're doing in common like who thought

you could stick a

phone on the windshield middle drive um

but like really the product that you're

building is not

something that people were not capable

of imagining 50 years ago

so no it doesn't change the world in

that front could people imagine the

internet 50 years ago only true

junior genius visionaries yeah everyone

could have imagined autonomous cars 50

years ago

it's like a core but i don't drive it

see i i have this sense

and i told you like i'm my long-term

dream

is robots with which you have deep

with whom you have deep connections

right

and there's different trajectories

towards that

and i've been thinking so i've been

thinking of launching a startup

i see autonomous vehicles as a potential

trajectory to that that

i'm that's not where the direction i

would like to go but

i also see tesla or even kamehameha like

pivoting into

into robotics broadly defined

that's at some stage in the way like

you're mentioning the internet didn't

expect

let's solve you know when i say a comma

about this we could talk about this but

let's solve self-driving cars first

got to stay focused on the mission don't

don't don't you're not too big to fail

for however much i think kama's winning

like no no

no you're winning when you solve level

five self-driving cars and until then

you haven't win and

one and you know again you want to be

arrogant in the face of other people

great you want to be arrogant in the

face of nature you're an idiot right

stay mission focused brilliantly put uh

like i mentioned

thinking of launching a startup i've

been considering actually before

cove i've been thinking of moving to san

francisco oh

oh i wouldn't go there so why is uh

okay well and now i'm thinking about

potentially austin

um and we're in san diego now san diego

come here

so why what um

i mean you're such an interesting human

you've launched so many successful

things

what uh why san diego what do you

recommend why not san francisco

have you thought so for in your case san

diego with qualcomm and snapdragon i

mean

that's an amazing combination but that

wasn't really why

that wasn't the why no i mean qualcomm

was an afterthought qualcomm was it was

a nice thing to think about it's like

you can have

a tech company here and a good one i

mean you know i like qualcomm but

no um what's the west san diego better

than stephanie why does san francisco

suck

well so okay so first off we all kind of

said like we want to stay in california

people like the ocean you know

california

for for its flaws it's like a lot of the

flaws of california are not necessarily

california as a whole and they're much

more san francisco specific

yeah um san francisco so i think first

year cities in general

have stopped wanting growth uh

well you have like in san francisco you

know the voting class always votes to

not build more houses because they own

all the houses and they're like well

you know once people have figured out

how to vote themselves more money

they're going to do it

it is so insanely corrupt um it is not

balanced at all

like political party-wise you know it's

it's a one-party city and

for all the discussion of diversity it's

has it's stops lacking real diversity of

thought of background of uh

approaches to strategies of yeah ideas

it's it's kind of a strange place that

it's the loudest

people about diversity and the biggest

lack of diversity

well i mean that's that's what they say

right it's the projection

projection yeah yeah it's interesting

and even people in silicon valley tell

me that's uh

like high up people but everybody is

like this is a terrible place it doesn't

make i mean and coronavirus is really

what killed it yeah

san francisco was the number one uh

exodus

during coronavirus we still think san

diego is a good place to be

yeah yeah i mean we'll see

we'll see what happens with california

a bit longer term yeah i like austrians

and austin's an interesting choice i

wouldn't i wouldn't i don't have really

anything bad to say about austin

either except for the extreme heat in

the summer um which you know but that's

like very on the surface right i think

as far as like an ecosystem

goes it's it's cool i personally love

colorado

colorado uh yeah i mean you have these

states that are

you know like just way better run

um california is you know it's

especially san francisco so it's high

horse and like

yeah can i ask you for advice

to me and to others about

what's it take to build a successful

startup oh i don't know i haven't done

that

talk to someone who did that well you

know

uh this is like another book of years

that i'll buy for 67

i suppose uh so there's um

one of these days will sell out yeah

that's right jail breaks are going to be

a dollar and books are going to be 67.

how i uh how i joe broke the iphone by

george cotts that's right

how i jailbroke the iphone and you can

do it

that's right that's right oh god okay i

can't wait but

quite so you haven't introspected you

have built

a very unique company i mean

not not you but you and others

but i don't know um there's no

there's nothing you have an interest but

you haven't really sat down and thought

about like

well like if you and i we're having a

bunch of we're having some beers

and you're seeing that i'm depressed and

whatever i'm struggling

there's no advice you can give oh i mean

more beer more beer

yeah i think it's all very like

situation dependent

um here's okay if i can give a generic

piece of advice

it's the technology always wins the

better technology

always wins and lying always

loses build technology

and don't lie i'm with you i agree very

much

the long run long run sure it's the long

run you know what the market can remain

irrational longer than you can remain

solvent

true fact well this is this is an

interesting point because i

ethically and just as a human believe

that um

like sm like hype and smoke and mirrors

is not at any stage of the company is a

good strategy

i mean there's some like you know pr

magic kind of like

you know you want a new product yeah if

there's a call to action

if there's like a call to action like

buy my new gpu look at it it takes up

three slots and it's this big it's huge

buy my g for you yeah

that's great if you look at you know

especially in that in the ai space

broadly but autonomous vehicles

like you can raise a huge amount of

money on nothing

and the question to me is like i'm

against that i'll never be

part of that i don't think i hope not

willingly not but like is there

something to be said

to uh essentially lying to raise

money like fake it till you make it kind

of thing

i mean this is billy mcfarland the fire

festival like we all we all

experienced uh you know what happens

with that no

no don't fake it till you make it be

honest

and hope you make it the whole way the

technology wins

right the technology wins and like there

is i'm not

i use like the anti-hype you know that's

that's a slava kpss reference but

um hype isn't necessarily bad

i loved camping out for the iphones

um you know and as long as the hype is

backed by

like substance as long as it's backed by

something i can actually

buy and like it's real then hype is

great and it's a great

feeling it's when the hype is backed by

lies that it's a bad feeling

i mean a lot of people call elon musk a

fraud how could he be a fraud

i've noticed this this kind of

interesting effect which is

he does tend to over promise

and deliver what's what's the better way

to phrase it

promise a timeline that he doesn't

deliver on he delivers much

later on what do you think about that

because i do that i think that's a

programmer thing

yeah i do that as well you think that's

a really bad thing to do or

is that okay i think that's again as

long as like

you're working toward it and you're

gonna deliver on it

it's not too far off right

right like like you know the whole the

whole

autonomous vehicle thing it's like i

mean i still think

tesla's on track to beat us i still

think even with their even with their

missteps they

have advantages we don't have um

you know illness is better than me at

at like marshaling massive amounts of

resources

so you know i still think given the fact

they're maybe making some wrong

decisions

they'll end up winning and like

it's fine to hype it if you're actually

gonna win

right if elon says look we're gonna be

landing rockets back on earth in a year

and it takes four

like you know he landed a rocket back on

earth

and he was working toward it the whole

time i think there's some amount of like

i think when it becomes wrong is if you

know you're not gonna meet that deadline

if you're lying yeah that's brilliantly

put like

this is what people don't understand i

think

like elon believes everything he says he

does

as far as i can tell he does and i i

detected that

in myself too like if i it's only

 if

you're like conscious of yourself lying

yeah i think so yeah you know you can't

take that to such an extreme

right like in a way i think maybe billy

mcfarland believed everything he said

too

right that's how you started cult and

everybody uh kills themselves

yeah yeah like it's you need you need if

there's like some

factor on it it's fine and you need some

people to like

you know keep you in check but like

if you deliver on most of the things you

say and just the timelines are off

yeah it does piss people off though i

wonder

but who cares in the long arc of history

the people

everybody gets pissed off at the people

who succeed which is

one of the things that frustrates me

about this world

is uh they don't celebrate

the success of others like

there's so many people that want elon to

fail

it's so fascinating to me like what

is wrong with you like so

elon musk talks about like people short

like they talk about financial

yeah but i think it's much bigger than

the financials i've seen like the human

factors community they

want they want other people to fail

why why why like even people the

harshest thing is like

you know even people that like seem to

really hate donald trump

they want him to fail yeah or like the

other president or

they want barack obama to fail it's like

we're almost involved it's weird but i

i want that i would love to inspire that

part of the world to change

because well damn it if the human

species is going to survive we should

celebrate success

like it seems like the efficient thing

to do in this objective function that

like we're all striving for

is to celebrate the ones that like

figure out how to like do better

at that objective function as opposed to

like dragging them down

back into them into the mud i think

there is

this is the speech i always give about

the commenters on hacker news

um so first off something to remember

about the internet in general

is commenters are not representative of

the population

yeah i don't comment on anything i don't

you know

commenters are are representative of a

certain sliver of the population

and on hacker news a common thing i'll

say is when you'll see something that's

like

you know promises to be wild out there

and

in innovative there is some amount of

you know checking them back to earth but

there's also some amount of

if this thing succeeds well

i'm 36 and i've worked at large tech

companies my whole life

they can't succeed because if they

succeed that would mean that i could

have done something different with my

life

but we know that i couldn't have we know

that i couldn't have and and that's why

they're going to fail

and they have to root for them to fail

to kind of maintain their world image

so tune it out and they comment well

it's hard i uh so one of the things one

of the things i'm considering

startup wise is to change that

because i think the i think it's also

a technology problem it's a platform

problem i agree it's like

because the thing you said most people

don't comment

i think most people want to comment

they just don't because it's all the

 for commenting exactly i don't

want to be grouped in with that or not

you don't want to be in a at a party

where everyone is an

yeah so they but that's a platform

problem that's

i can't believe what reddit's become i

can't believe the group think in reddit

comments

there's a red is an interesting one

because they're subreddits

and so you can still see especially

small subreddits

that like that are little like havens of

like

joy and positivity and like deep

even disagreement but like nuanced

discussion but it's only like small

little pockets

but that's uh that's emergent the

platform's not helping that or

hurting that so i guess naturally

something about the internet uh if you

don't put in a lot of effort to

encourage

nuance and positive good vibes it's

naturally going to decline into chaos

i would love to see someone do this well

yeah um i think it's

yeah very doable this is uh i think

actually so

i i feel like twitter could be

overthrown joshua bach talked about how

like uh if you have like and retweet

like

that's only positive wiring right

the only way to do anything like

negative there

is um with a comment and

that's like that asymmetry is what gives

you know twitter its particular

toxicness

whereas i find youtube comments to be

much better because youtube comments

have a have a

of an up and a down and they don't show

the downloads

without getting into depth of this

particular discussion

the point is to explore possibilities

and get a lot of data on it because uh

i mean i could disagree with what you

just said it's it's uh the point is it's

unclear

it's a it hasn't been explored in a

really rich way

like the these questions of how to

create

platforms that encourage positivity yeah

i think it's a it's a technology problem

and i think we'll look back at twitter

as it is now maybe it'll happen within

twitter

but most likely somebody overthrows them

is

we'll look back at twitter and say we

can't believe we put up with this level

of toxicity you need a different

business model too

any any social network that

fundamentally has advertising as a

business model

this was in the social dilemma which i

didn't watch but i liked it it's like

you know there's always the you know

you're the product you're not the uh but

they had a nuanced take on it that i

really liked and it said

the product being sold is influence over

you

the product being sold is literally your

you know

influence on you like

that can't be if that's your idea okay

well

you know guess what it cannot be toxic

yeah

maybe there's ways to spin it like with

with uh giving

a lot more control to the user and

transparency to see what is happening to

them as opposed to

in the shadows as possible but that

can't be the primary source of

but the users aren't no one's going to

use that it depends

it depends it depends i think i think

that the you're

you're not going to you can't depend on

self-awareness of the users

it's a it's another it's a longer

discussion because uh

you can't depend on it but

you can reward self-awareness

like if for the ones who are willing to

put in the work of self-awareness

you can reward them and incentivize and

perhaps be pleasantly surprised how many

people

are are willing to be self-aware on the

internet

like we are in real life like i'm

putting a lot of effort with you right

now

being self-aware about if i say

something stupid or mean

sure i'll like look at your like body

language like i'm putting in that effort

it's costly for an introvert it's very

costly

but on the internet it

like most people are like i don't care

if if this hurts somebody i don't care

if this uh

is not interesting or if this is yeah

the mean or whatever

i think so much of the engagement today

on the internet is so disingenuous too

yeah you're not doing this out of a

genuine this is what you think you're

doing this just straight up to

manipulate others whether you're in you

just became an ad okay

okay let's talk about a fun topic which

is programming

here's another book idea for you let me

pitch uh what's your uh perfect

programming setup

so like this by george hotz so

uh like what listen you're

giving me give me a macbook air sitting

in a corner of a hotel room and you know

i'll still have so you really don't care

you don't

fetishize like multiple monitors

keyboard

uh those things are nice and i'm not

going to say no to them

but do they automatically unlock tons of

productivity no not at all i have

definitely been more productive on a

macbook air in a corner of a hotel room

what about ide

so uh which operating system

do you love what uh text editor do you

use

ide what um is there is there something

that

is like the perfect if you could just

say the perfect productivity

set up for george hawks doesn't matter

it doesn't doesn't matter

it really doesn't matter you know i

guess i code most of the time in vim

like literally i'm using an editor from

the 70s you know you didn't

make anything better okay vs code is

nice for reading code there's a few

things that are nice about

it uh i think that they're you can build

much better tools

how like ida's xrefs work way better

than vx vs codes why

yeah actually that's a good question

like why i i still use

sorry emacs eat for most uh

i've actually know i have to confess

something dark

cause i've never used bim yeah

it's i think maybe i'm just afraid

that my life has been a like a waste

[Laughter]

i'm so i'm not i'm not evangelical about

emacs i

i think this this is how i feel about

tender flow versus pie torch

yeah having just like we've switched

everything to pie torch now put months

into the switch

i have felt like i've wasted years on

tensorflow i can't believe it

i can't believe how much better pie

torch is yeah

i've used emacs and them doesn't matter

yeah still just my heart

somehow i fell in love with lisp i don't

know why you can't

the heart wants what the heart wants i

don't i don't understand it but it just

connected with me maybe it's the

functional language at first i connected

with

maybe it's because so many of the ai

courses before the deep learning

revolution were taught

with lisp in mind i don't know i don't

know what it is but i'm i'm

stuck with it but at the same time like

why am i not using a modern id for some

of these programming like i don't know

they're not that much better i've used

modernity to use them but at the same

time so

to just not to disagree with you but

like i like multiple monitors

like i've i have to do work on a laptop

and

it's a it's a pain in the ass and also

i'm addicted to the

kinesis weird keyboard that you could

you could see

uh yeah so you don't have any of that

you can just be in a macbook

i mean look at work i have three 24-inch

monitors i have a happy hacking keyboard

i have a

razer death header mouse like but it's

not essential for you no

let's go to a day in the life of george

hotz what is the

perfect day productivity-wise so we're

not talking about like

hunter s thompson uh drugs yeah and uh

let's let's look at productivity like

what

what's the day look like on like hour by

hour is there any

irregularities that create a magical

george hawks experience

i can remember three days in my life and

i remember these days vividly

when i've gone through kind of

radical transformations to the way i

think

and what i would give i would pay a

hundred thousand dollars if i could have

one of these days tomorrow

um the days have been so impactful and

one was first discovering eliezer

yukowski on the singularity

and reading that stuff and like you know

my mind was blown

um the next was discovering

uh the hutter price and then ai is just

compression

like finally understanding aix i and

what all that was

you know i like read about it when i was

18 19 i didn't understand it and then

the fact that like lossless compression

implies intelligence

the day that i was shown that and then

the third one is controversial

the day i found a blog called

unqualified reservations

and uh read that and i was like

wait which one is that that's uh what's

the guy's name curtis garvin

yeah so many people tell me i'm supposed

to talk to him

yeah but he looks he sounds insane or

brilliant

but insane or both i don't know the day

i found that blog was another like this

was during like like

gamergate and kind of the run-up to the

2016 election and i'm like

wow okay the world makes sense now this

this like i had a framework now to

interpret this just like i got the

framework for ai and a framework to

interpret technological progress like

those days when i discovered these new

frameworks were oh interesting it's just

not about

but what was special about those days

how did those days come to be

is it just you got lucky like sure i

like

well you just encounter hutter prize on

uh on hack news or something like that

um like what but you see i don't think

it's just

see i don't think it's just that like i

could have gotten lucky at any point i

think that in a way

you were ready at that moment yeah

exactly to receive the information

but is there some magic to the day today

of like

like eating breakfast and it's the

mundane things

nah nothing no i drift i drift through

life

without structure i drift through life

hoping and praying that i will get

another day like those days

and there's nothing in particular you do

to uh to be a receptacle

for another for day number four

no i didn't do anything to get the other

ones so i don't think i have to really

do anything now i took a month-long trip

to new york and

i mean the ethereum thing was the

highlight of it but the rest of it was

pretty terrible

i did a two-week road trip and i got i

had to turn around i had to turn around

i'm driving in uh

in gunnison colorado i passed through

gunnison and uh

the snow starts coming down this path up

there called monarch pass in order to

get through to denver you gotta get over

the rockies

and i had to turn my car around i

couldn't i watched

i watched a f-150 go off the road i'm

like i gotta go back and

like that day was meaningful because

like like it was real like i actually

had to turn my car around

um it's rare that anything even real

happens in my life even as

you know mundane is the fact that yeah

there was snow

i had to turn around stay in gunnison

and leave the next day something about

that moment for

real okay so actually it's interesting

to break apart the three moments you

mentioned

if it's okay so uh i always have trouble

pronouncing his name but

allows yakowski yeah

so what how did your

world view change in starting to

consider

the the exponential growth of ai and agi

that

he thinks about and the the the threats

of artificial intelligence and all that

kind of ideas like

can you is it j like can you maybe uh

break apart like what

exactly was so magical to use a

transformational experience

today everyone knows him for threats and

ai safety um this was pre

that stuff there was i don't think a

mention of ai safety on the page

um this is this is old yukowski stuff

he'd probably denounce it all now he'd

probably be like that's exactly what i

didn't want to happen

well sorry man

is there something specific you can take

from his work that you can remember

yeah uh it was this realization that

uh computers double in power every 18

months

and humans do not and they haven't

crossed yet

but if you have one thing that's

doubling every 18 months and one thing

that's staying like this

you know here's your log graph here's

your line

you know you calculate that

and that did that open the door to the

exponential thinking

like thinking that like you know what

with technology we can actually

transformed the world

it opened the door to human obsolescence

it opened the door to realize that in my

lifetime

humans are going to be replaced

and then the matching idea to that of

artificial intelligence with the hutter

prize

you know i'm torn i go back and forth on

what i think about it

yeah but the the the basic thesis

is it's nice to com it's a nice

compelling notion that

we can reduce the task of creating an

intelligent system a general

intelligence system

into the task of compression so you can

think of all of intelligence in the

universe in fact

as a kind of compression

do you find that was that just at the

time you found that as a compelling idea

do you still find that

a compelling idea i still find that

compelling idea

um i think that it's not that useful day

to day

but actually um one of maybe my quests

before that was a search for the

definition of the word intelligence

and i never had one and i definitely

have a definition of the word

compression

it's a very uh simple uh straightforward

one

and uh you know what confession is you

know what lossless is lossless

compassion not lossy lossless

compression

and that that is equivalent to

intelligence which i believe

i'm not sure how useful that definition

is day to day but like i now have a

framework to understand what it is

and he just 10x 10xed the uh the prize

for that competition like recently a few

months ago

you ever thought of taking a crack at

that oh i did

oh i did i spent i spent the next after

i found the prize i spent the next

six months of my life trying it and uh

well that's when i started learning

everything about

ai and then i worked vicarious for a bit

and then i learned

read all the deep learning stuff and i'm

like okay now i like i'm called up to

modern ai

wow and i had i had a really good

framework to put it all in from the

compression stuff

right like some of the first uh some of

the first deep learning models i played

with were

uh like gpt basically but before

transformers before it was still

uh rnn's to to do uh

character prediction but by the way on

the compression side

i mean the especially neural networks

what do you make of the lossless

requirement with the hudder prize so

you know human intelligence and neural

networks can probably compress

stuff pretty well but it would be lossy

it's imperfect

uh you can turn a lossy compressor into

a lossless compressor pretty easily

using an arithmetic encoder right you

can take an arithmetic encoder

and you can just encode the noise with

maximum efficiency

right so even if you can't predict

exactly what the next character is

the better a probability distribution

you can put over the next character

you can then use an arithmetic encoder

to uh right you don't have to know

whether it's an e or an i

you just have to put good probabilities

on them and then you know code those

and if you have it's a bits of entropy

thing right

so let me on that topic could be

interesting as a little side

tour what are your thoughts in this year

about gpt3

and these language models and these

transformers is there something

interesting

to you as an ai researcher or is there

something interesting to you

as an autonomous vehicle developer nah i

think uh

i think it's overhyped i mean it's not

like it's cool it's cool for what it is

but no

we're not just going to be able to scale

up to gpg 12 and get

general-purpose intelligence like your

loss function

is literally just you know you know

cross-entropy loss on the character

right like that's not the loss function

of general intelligence

is that obvious to you yes can you

imagine

that like to play devil's advocate on

yourself is it

possible that you can the gpt-12 will

achieve general intelligence

with something as dumb as this kind of

loss function

i guess it depends what you mean by

general intelligence

so there's another problem with the gpts

and that's that they don't have

a uh they don't have long-term memory

right right so like just

gpt 12 a scaled up version of gpt two or

three

i find it hard to believe

well you can scale it in it's yeah so

it's a hardcore

hard-coded length but you can make it

wider and wider and wider yeah

you're gonna get you're gonna get cool

things from those systems

but i i don't think you're ever gonna

get something that can like

you know build me a rocket ship what

about solve driving

so you know you can use transformer with

video for example

you think is there something in there no

because

hey look we use we as a group we use a

group we could change that group out to

a transformer

um i think driving is much more

markovian than language

so markov you mean like the memory which

which aspect of uh

i mean that like most of the information

in the state at t

minus one is also in the in is in state

t yeah right and it kind of like drops

off

nicely like this where sometime with

language you have to refer back to the

third paragraph on the second page

i feel like there's not many like like

you can say like speed limit signs but

there's really not many things in

autonomous driving that look like that

but if you look at uh to play devil's

advocate

is uh the risk estimation thing that

you've talked about it's kind of

interesting

is uh it feels like there might be some

longer term

uh aggregation of context necessary to

be able to figure out like

the context yeah i'm not even sure i'm

i'm believing my my own devil's we have

a nice we have a nice like vision model

which outputs like a a

one two four dimensional perception

space um

can i try transformers on it sure i

probably will

at some point we'll try transformers and

then we'll just see do they do better

sure

i'm well it might not be a game changer

no well i'm not like like

might transformers work better than

grooves for autonomous driving sure

might we switch sure is this some

radical change no

okay we use a slightly different you

know we switch from rnns to grooves

like okay maybe it's greased to

transformers but no it's not

yeah i well on the on the topic of

general intelligence i don't know

how much i've talked to you about it

like what um

do you think will actually build an agi

like if if you look at ray kurzweil with

a singularity do

you have like an intuition about you're

kind of saying driving is easy

yeah and i

i tend to personally believe that

solving driving

will have really deep important

impacts on our ability to solve general

intelligence

like i i think driving doesn't require

general intelligence

but i think they're going to be

neighbors in a way that it's like deeply

tied

because it's so like driving is so

deeply connected to the human experience

that i think solving one will help solve

the other

but but so i don't see i don't see

driving is like

easy and almost like separate than

general intelligence but like what's

your

vision of a future with a singular do

you see there'll be a single moment like

a singularity where it'll be a phase

shift

are we in the singularity now like what

do you have crazy ideas about the future

in terms of

agi we're definitely in the singularity

now um we are

coolers of course look at the bandwidth

between people the bandwidth between

people goes up

all right um the singularity is just you

know when the bandwidth but

what do you mean by the bandwidth of the

people communications tools the whole

world is networked

the whole world is networked and we

raise the speed of that network right

oh so you think the communication of

information in a

distributed way is a empowering thing

for collective intelligence

oh i didn't say it's necessarily a good

thing but i think that's like when i

think of the definition of the

singularity yeah it seems kind of right

i see like it's a change in the world

beyond which

like the world be transformed in ways

that we can't possibly imagine no i mean

i think we're in the singularity now in

the sense that there's like you know one

world and a monoculture and it's also

linked

yeah i mean i i kind of shared the

intuition that

the the singularity will originate from

the collective intelligence

of us ants versus the like some single

system agi

type thing oh i totally agree with that

yeah i don't i don't really believe in

like like a hard take off agi kind of

thing

um yeah i don't think i don't even think

ai is all that different

in kind from what we've already been

building

um with respect to driving i think

driving is a subset of general

intelligence and i think it's a pretty

complete subset

i think the tools we develop at comma

will also be extremely helpful

to solving general intelligence and

that's i think the real reason why i'm

doing it

i don't care about self-driving cars

it's a cool problem to beat people at

but yeah i mean yeah you're kind of

you're of two minds

so one you do have to have a mission and

you want to focus and make sure you

get you get there you can't forget that

but

at the same time there is a thread

that's much

bigger than uh the connects the entirety

of your effort that's much bigger than

just driving

with ai and with general intelligence it

is so easy to delude yourself

into thinking you've figured something

out when you haven't if we build a level

5 self-driving car

we have indisputably built something

yeah

is it general intelligence i'm not going

to debate that i will say we've built

something

that provides huge financial value yeah

beautifully put that's the engineering

credo like just just build the thing

it's like that's why i'm with uh with

the with elon on uh

go to mars yeah that's a great one you

can argue like

who the hell cares about going to mars

but the reality is

set that as a mission get it done yeah

and then you're going to crack some pro

problem that you've never even expected

in the process of doing that yeah

yeah i mean no i think if i had a choice

between humanity going to mars and

solving self-driving cars i think going

to mars is uh

better but i don't know i'm more suited

for self-driving cars i'm an information

guy i'm not a modernist i'm a

postmodernist

post modernist all right beautifully put

let me let me drag you back to

programming for a sec what

three maybe three to five programming

languages should people learn

do you think like if you look at

yourself what did you get the most out

of

from learning uh well so everybody

should learn

c and assembly we'll start with those

two right assembly

yeah if you can't code in assembly you

don't know what the computer's doing

you don't understand like you don't have

to be great in assembly but you have to

code in it and then like you have to

appreciate assembly in order to

appreciate all the great things c

gets you and then you have to code and

see in order to appreciate all the great

things python gets you

so i'll just say assembly c and python

we'll start with those three

the memory allocation of of c and the

the the fact that so assemblies give you

a sense of just how many levels of

abstraction

you get to work on in modern day

programs yeah yeah graph coloring for

assignment register assignment and

compilers yeah like you know you got to

do you know the compiler your computer

only has a certain number of registers

you can have all the variables you want

a c

function you know so you get to start

your build intuition about

compilation like what a compiler gets

you

what else um well then there's then

there's kind of uh

so those are all very imperative

programming languages um

then there's two other paradigms for

programming that everybody should be

familiar with

i'm one of them is functional uh you

should learn haskell and take that all

the way through

learn a language with dependent types

like

learn that whole space like the very pl

theory

heavy languages and haskell is your

favorite functional

what is that the go-to you would say

yeah i'm not a great haskell programmer

i

wrote a compiler in haskell once there's

another paradigm and actually there's

one more paradigm that i'll even talk

about

after that that i never used to talk

about when i would think about this but

the next paradigm is learn verilog of

hdl

um understand this idea of all of the

instructions execute at once

if i have a block in verilog and i write

stuff in it

it's not sequential they all execute it

once

and then like think like that that's how

hardware works

to be so i guess assembly doesn't quite

get you that

assembly's more about compilation and

verilog is more about the hardware

like giving a sense of what actually is

the hardware is doing

assembly c python are straight like they

sit right on top of each other in fact c

is well let's see it's kind of coded in

c but you could imagine the first c was

coded in assembly and python is actually

coded in c

um so you know you can straight up go on

that

got it and then verilog gives you that's

brilliant

okay and then i think there's another

one now everyone should carpathi calls

it programming 2.0

which is learn a i'm not even gonna

don't learn tensorflow learn pi torch so

machine learning

we've got to come up with a better term

than programming 2.0 or um

but yeah it's a programming language

i wonder if it could be formalized a

little bit better which we feels like

we're in the early days

of what that actually entails

data-driven programming

data-driven programming yeah but it's so

fundamentally different as a paradigm

than the others uh like it almost

requires a different skill set

but you think it's still yeah

and ply torch versus tensorflow pytorch

wins it's the fourth paradigm it's the

fourth paradigm that i've kind of seen

there's like this you know imperative

functional hardware i don't know a

better word for it

and then ml do you have advice

for people uh that want to you know get

into programming want to learn

programming you have a

a video uh what is programming new

blessings exclamation point

and i think the top comment is like

warning this is not for noobs

uh do you have a noob like uh

tldw for that video but also uh

a new but friendly advice on

how to get into programming you are

never going to learn programming by

watching a video

called learn programming the only way to

learn programming i think and the only

one is the only way

everyone i've ever met who can program

well learned it all in the same way they

had something they wanted to do

and then they tried to do it and then

they were like

oh well okay this is kind of you know be

nice if the computer could kind of do

this thing and then

you know that's how you learn you just

keep pushing on a project

um so the only advice i have for

learning programming is go program

somebody wrote to me a question like we

don't really

they're looking to learn about recurring

neural networks

he's saying like my company is thinking

of doing recruit using recurring neural

networks for time series data

but we don't really have an idea of

where to use it yet

we just want to like do you have any

advice on how to learn about

these are these kind of general machine

learning questions and i think

the answer is like actually

have a problem that you're trying to

solve and and just i see that stuff oh

my god when people talk like that

they're like

i heard machine learning's important

could you help us integrate machine

learning with macaroni and cheese

production

you just i don't even you can't help

these people like who lets you run

anything who lets that kind of person

run anything

i think we're we're all um we're all

beginners at some point

so it's not like they're a beginner it's

it's like

my problem is not that they don't know

about machine learning my problem is

that they think that

machine learning has something to say

about macaroni and cheese production

or like i heard about this new

technology how can i use it for why

like i don't know what it is but how can

i use it for why

that's true you have to build up an

intuition of how because you might be

able to figure out a way but

like the prerequisites you should have a

macaroni and cheese problem to solve

first

exactly and then two you should

have more traditional like in the

learning process should involve

more traditionally applicable problems

in the space of whatever that is of

machine learning

and then see if it could be applied to

background at least start with tell me

about a problem like if you have a

problem you're like

you know some of my boxes aren't getting

enough macaroni in them

um can we use machine learning to solve

this problem that's

much much better than how do i apply

machine learning to macaroni and cheese

one big thing maybe this is me uh

talking to the audience a little bit

because i get these days

so many messages a device on how to like

learn stuff okay my

this this this is not me being mean i

think this is quite a profound actually

is you should google it oh yeah

like one of the uh

like skills that you should really

acquire as an engineer

as a researcher as a thinker like one

there's two

two complementary skills like one is

with a blank sheet of paper with no

internet to think deeply

and then the other is to google the crap

out of the questions you have like

that's actually a skill i

don't people often talk about but like

doing research like pulling at the

thread like looking up different words

going into like

github repositories with two stars and

like looking how they did stuff like

looking at the code or going on twitter

seeing like there's little pockets of

brilliant people that are like having

discussions

like if you're a neuroscientist go into

signal processing community if you're an

ai person going into the

psychology community like like switch

communities that keep searching

searching searching

because it's so much better

to invest in like finding somebody else

who already solved your problem

than than this to try to solve the

problem and because they've

often invested years of their life like

entire communities

are probably already out there who have

tried to solve your problem

i think they're the same thing i think

you go try to solve the problem

and then in trying to solve the problem

if you're good at solving problems

you'll stumble upon the person who

solved it already yeah

but the stumbling is really important i

think that's a skill that people should

really approach especially in undergrad

like search if you ask me a question how

should i get started in deep learning

like especially

like that is just so google like

the whole point is you google that and

you get a million pages

and just start looking at them yeah

start pulling at the thread

start exploring start taking notes start

getting it

advice from a million people that

already like spent their

life answering that question actually oh

well yeah i mean that's definitely also

yeah when people like ask me things like

that i'm like trust me the top answer on

google is much much better than anything

i'm going to tell you

right yeah people ask

it's an interesting question let me know

if you have any recommendations what

three books

technical or fiction or philosophical

had an impact

on your life or you would recommend

perhaps uh

maybe we'll start with the least

controversial uh infinite jest

um infinite jest is a

david foster wallace yeah it's a book

about wireheading really

very enjoyable to read very uh

well-written

you know you will you will you will grow

as a person reading this book

uh it's effort um and i'll set that up

for the second book which is pornography

it's called atlas shrugged um

uh which um atlas drug is pornography

i mean it is i will not i will not

defend the i will not say atlas shrugged

is a well-written book

it is entertaining to read certainly

just like pornography

the production value isn't great um you

know there's a 60-page

monologue in there that ann rand's

editor really wanted to take out

and she uh paid she paid out of her

pocket to keep that 60 page monologue in

the book

um but it is a great book for a kind of

framework um of human relations

and i know a lot of people are like yeah

but it's a terrible framework

yeah but it's a framework just for

context

in a couple days i'm speaking with for

uh

probably four plus hours with euron

brook who's

the main living remaining objectivists

objectivist interesting uh so

i've always found this philosophy quite

interesting on many levels one of how

repulsive

some percent of large percent of the

population find it

which is always uh always funny to me

when people

are like unable to even read a

philosophy

because uh of some i think that says

more about their psychological

perspective on it

yeah but but there is something about

objectivism and iran's philosophy that's

very deeply connected to this idea of

capitalism

of uh the ethical life is the productive

life

um that was always um

compelling to me it didn't seem as like

i didn't seem to interpret it in the

negative sense that some people do

to be fair i read that book when i was

19. so you had an impact at that point

yeah

yeah and the the bad guys in the book

have this slogan from each according to

their ability to each according to their

need

and i'm looking at this and i'm like

these are the most cards this is team

rocket level cartoonishness

right no bad guy and then when i

realized that was actually the slogan of

the communist party

i'm like wait a second wait no no no no

no just you're telling me this really

happened yeah it's interesting i mean

one of the criticisms of her work is she

has a cartoonish view of good and evil

like

that there's like the the reality isn't

jordan peterson says this

is that each of us have the capacity for

good and evil in us as opposed to like

there's some characters who are purely

evil and some characters are purely good

and that's in a way why it's

pornographic

the production value i love it well evil

is punished and there's very clearly

you know there's no there's no you know

uh just like porn doesn't have uh you

know like character growth well you know

neither does alex shrugged like

brilliant well put but as a 19 year old

george cotts it was

it was good enough yeah yeah what uh

what's the third

you have something um i i could give

these these two i'll just throw out uh

there's sci-fi uh permutation city

um great things to start thinking about

copies of yourself and then um

that is uh greg egan

uh he's uh that might not be his real

name some australian guy might not be

australian

i don't know um and then this one's

online it's called the metamorphosis of

prime intellect

um it's a story set in a

post-singularity world it's interesting

is there uh can you if either of the

worlds do you find something uh

philosophy interesting in them that you

can comment on

i mean it is clear to me that uh

metamorphosis prime intellect is like

written by

an engineer uh which is

it's very it's very almost a pragmatic

take on a utopia in a way

positive or negative well that's up to

you to decide reading the book

and the ending of it is very interesting

as well and i didn't realize what it was

i first read that when i was 15. i've

reread that book several times in my

life

and it's sure it's 50 pages everyone

should go read it

what's uh sorry this is a little tangent

i've been working through the foundation

i've been i've haven't read much sci-fi

my whole life and i'm trying to fix that

the last few months that's been a little

side project

what's uh to use the greatest sci-fi

novel

uh that uh people should read or is that

or

i mean i would yeah i would i would say

like yeah permutation city metamorphosis

environmental i got it

um i don't know i i didn't like

foundation uh i thought it was way too

modernist

i feel like dune i've never read dune

i've never read dune i have to read it

uh fire upon the deep is

interesting uh

okay i mean look everyone should read

everyone's reading romance everyone

should read snow crash

if you haven't read those like start

there um yeah i haven't read snow

questions

yeah no it means very entertaining go to

lecture bach and if you want the

controversial one

bronze age mindset

all right i'll look into that one those

aren't sci-fi

but just to round out books so

a bunch of people asked me on twitter

and read it and so on for advice

so what advice would you give a young

person today about life

another way

what uh yeah i mean looking back

especially when you're

young younger you did and you continued

it

you've accomplished a lot of interesting

things

is there some advice from those

i'm that life of yours that you can pass

on if college ever opens again i would

love to give a graduation speech

um at that point i will put a lot of

somewhat satirical effort into this

question

yeah at this you haven't written

anything at this point

oh you know what always wear sunscreen

this is water

like you're plagiarizing i mean you know

but that's the that's the like clean

your room

you know yeah you can play drugs from

from all this stuff and it's it's

there is no self-help books aren't

designed to help you they're designed to

make you feel good

like whatever advice i could give you

already know

everyone already knows sorry it doesn't

feel good

right like you know you know what what

if

if i tell you that you should you know

eat well and and and read more and

it's not gonna do anything i think the

whole like genre of those kind of

questions is

is is meaningless i don't know if

anything

it's don't worry so much about that

stuff don't be so caught up in your head

right i mean you're yeah in the sense

that your whole life

is your whole existence is like moving

version of that advice

i don't know yeah

there's there's something i mean there's

something in you that resists that kind

of thinking and that in itself

is it's just illustrative of uh

who you are and there's something to

learn from that

i think you're you're clearly not

overthinking stuff

yeah and you know it's a gut thing i

even when i talk about my advice i'm

like my advice is only relevant to me

it's not relevant to anybody else i'm

not saying you should go out if you're

the kind of person who overthinks things

to stop overthinking things it's not bad

it doesn't work for me maybe it works

for you i you know i don't know

let me ask you about love yeah

uh so i think last time we talked about

the meaning of life

and it was it was kind of about winning

of course uh i don't think i've talked

to you about

love much whether romantic or just love

for

the common humanity amongst us all what

role has love played in your life in

this

in this quest for winning where does

love fit in

well the word love i think means uh

several different things there's

uh love in the sense of maybe i could

just say there's like love in the sense

of opiates and love in the sense of

uh oxytocin and then love in the sense

of

maybe like a love for math i don't think

fits into either those first two

paradigms

uh so each of those have they uh

have they have they given something to

you

in your life i'm not that big of a fan

of the first two

um what

the same reason i'm not a fan of you

know the same reason i

don't do opiates and don't take ecstasy

right

and there were times look i've tried

both um

i like opiates way more than i liked

ecstasy uh but they're not

the ethical life is the productive life

so maybe that's

my problem with with those and then like

yeah a sense of

i don't know like abstract love for

humanity

i mean the abstract love for humanity

i'm like yeah i've always

felt that and i guess it's hard for me

to imagine not feeling it and maybe

there's people who don't and

i don't know but yeah that's just like a

background thing that's there

i mean since we brought up uh drugs let

me ask you

this is becoming more and more part of

my life because i'm talking a few

researchers that are working on

psychedelics

i've eaten shrooms a couple times and it

was

fascinating to me that like the mind can

go

like it's fascinating the mine can go to

places i didn't imagine it could go and

it was

very friendly and and positive and

exciting and

everything was kind of hilarious in the

in the place wherever my mind went

that's where i went

is uh what do you think about

psychedelics do you think they have

where do you think the mind goes have

you done psychedelics

where do you think the mind goes uh is

there something useful to learn about

the places it goes

once you come back you know i find it

interesting

that this idea that psychedelics have

something to teach

is almost unique to psychedelics right

people don't argue this about

amphetamines and

that's true and i'm not really sure why

yeah i think

all of the drugs have lessons to teach i

think there's things to learn from

opiates i think there's things to learn

from amphetamines i think there's things

to learn from psychedelics things to

learn from marijuana

um but also at the same time

recognize that i don't think you're

learning things about the world i think

you're learning things about yourself

yes um and you know what's the

even though it might have even been uh

might have been a timothy leary quote i

don't want to miss about him but the

idea is basically like

you know everybody should look behind

the door but then once you've seen

behind the door you don't need to keep

going back

um so i mean and that's my thoughts on

on all real drug use too

except maybe for caffeine it's a it's a

little experience

that uh it's good to have but oh yeah no

i mean

yeah i guess yeah psychedelics are

definitely um

so you're a fan of new experiences i

suppose yes because they all

contain a little especially the first

few times it contains some lessons that

could be picked up

yeah and i'll i'll revisit psychedelics

maybe once a year

um usually small smaller doses

maybe they turn up the learning rate of

your brain i've heard that

i like that yeah that's cool big

learning rates have pros and cons

last question this is a little weird one

but you've called yourself

crazy in the past uh

first of all on a scale of one to ten

how crazy would you say

are you oh i mean it depends how you you

know when you compare me to elon musk

and anthony lewandowski not so crazy

so like like a seven let's go with six

six yes six what uh

well like seven seven's a good number

seven sorry well yeah i'm sure

day by day changes right so but you're

in that

in that area what uh

in thinking about that what do you think

is the role of madness

is that a feature or a bug if you were

to uh dissect your

brain so okay from like a

like mental health lens on crazy

i'm not sure i really believe in that

i'm not sure i really believe in like

a lot of that stuff right this concept

of

okay you know when you get over to like

like like like

hardcore bipolar and schizophrenia these

things are clearly

real somewhat biological and then over

here on the spectrum you have like

a dd and oppositional defiance disorder

and

these things that are like wait this is

normal spectrum human behavior like this

isn't

you know where's the the line here and

why is this like a

problem so there's this whole this you

know the neurodiversity of humanity is

huge like people think i'm always on

drugs people are saying this to me on my

streams and like guys you know like i'm

real open with my drug use i'd tell you

if i was on drugs

yeah i had like a cup of coffee this

morning but other than that this is just

me

you're witnessing my brain and action

so so the word madness doesn't even uh

make sense and then you're in the rich

neurodiversity of

humans i think it makes sense but only

for

like some insane extremes like if you

are

actually like visibly hallucinating

um you know that's okay but there is the

kind of spectrum on which you stand out

like that that's uh like if i were to

look you know at decorations on a

christmas tree or something like that

like if you were a decoration out that

would catch my eye like

that thing is sparkly

whatever the hell that thing is uh

there's something to that

just like refusing to be um

boring or maybe boring is the wrong word

but to um

yeah i mean be willing to sparkle

you know it's it's like somewhat

constructed i mean

i am who i choose to be uh

i'm gonna say things as true as i can

see them i'm not gonna i'm not gonna

lie and but that's a really important

feature in itself so like whatever the

neurodiversity of your

whatever your brain is not putting um

constraints on it that force it to to

fit into the mold of what society is

like

defines what you're supposed to be so

you're one of the specimens that

that doesn't mind being yourself

being right is super important

except at the expense of being wrong

without breaking that apart i think it's

a beautiful way to end it and george
