When they are present, Wasp will add the necessary NPM dependencies and copy your config files into the generated project output. You can then start adding [Tailwind CSS directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#directives) to your CSS files and `className`s to your React components.  ### New project tree overview ```bash title=\"tree .\" {6,13-14} . â”œâ”€â”€ main.wasp â”œâ”€â”€ src â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ client â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json",

If you name them with `.js` extension, Wasp will not be able to find them and Tailwind integration will not work. :::  #### 1) Add `./tailwind.config.cjs` ```js title=\"./tailwind.config.cjs\" /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */ module.exports = {",
